The provocative finding joins a flurry of other recent, sometimes controversial work attempting to find factors that explain the apparent antiaging properties of young blood.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;These are exciting results,&#8221; says Sally Temple, scientific director of the Neural Stem Cell Institute in Rensselaer, New York, who was not involved with the work. She and others say the new finding suggests that this and other factors in young blood may have different, complementary effects on the aging brain.</p>\n\n<p>Decades ago in somewhat grisly experiments, researchers found that sewing together the circulatory systems of an old and young mouse so that they shared the same blood supply rejuvenated the old animals. In 2014, as part of renewed interest in this unusual procedure, known as parabiosis, neuroscientist Tony Wyss-Coray&#8217;s lab at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, reported that it could mimic some of the brain-boosting effects of parabiosis with&#160;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/05/young-blood-renews-old-mice">injections of young mouse plasma, the cell-free part of blood</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Identifying the responsible factors in such blood is a challenge, however. Because mice are so tiny, it&#8217;s hard to collect enough mouse plasma to do biochemical and other analyses. As an alternative, Wyss-Coray&#8217;s lab recently tested the youngest human blood available&#8212;umbilical cord blood, which is traditionally thrown away after a birth but has become increasingly prized as physicians explore its therapeutic uses.</p>\n\n<p>In the new work, Wyss-Coray&#8217;s group gave human cord blood plasma to mice of varying ages that had defective immune systems and so did not reject the foreign human tissue. Like young mouse plasma, human cord plasma injected every 4 days for 2 weeks into the circulation activated neurons in old mice&#8217;s hippocampi, where memories are made and stored. (This activation did not happen in the hippocampi of young mice treated with cord blood.) After the injections, the aging animals also navigated a maze more quickly and performed better on other tests of learning and memory, Wyss-Coray&#8217;s team&#160;<a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature22067">reports today in&#160;<cite>Nature</cite></a>.</p>\n\n<p>The team then looked for blood proteins that are abundant in human cords but decline in the general circulation with age. They ultimately homed in one called TIMP2, which was previously known to control the production of enzymes that chop up the matrix around cells and play a role in wound healing as well as the spread of cancer. (Its full name is tissue metallopeptidase inhibitor 2.) Old mice injected with mouse TIMP2 scored almost as well on memory tests as those given cord plasma, although they still didn&#8217;t match the cognitive skills of young mice, Wyss-Coray says. To help clinch its case for TIMP2, the Stanford group also showed that cord blood depleted of TIMP2 did nothing for old mice, and blocking TIMP2 in young mice impaired their memory.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers&#8217; search for antiaging factors did not point to another protein,&#160;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/05/young-blood-renews-old-mice">GDF11</a>, which some scientists have reported stimulates the growth of new blood vessels and neural stem cells in the brain. (Another claim&#8212;that GDF11 rejuvenates muscle&#8212;has been hotly contested by several labs, partly because&#160;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/10/antiaging-protein-real-deal-harvard-team-claims">their studies suggest GDF11 levels rise with age</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>But Wyss-Coray says the new study does not rule on a role for GDF11 in the brain. Harvard University neuroscientist Lee Rubin, who co-led the GDF11 brain study, says the new findings suggest &#8220;it isn&#8217;t just one thing. A lot of individual factors in blood can improve function.&#8221; Indeed, one might want to combine GDF11 and TIMP2 treatments to both generate new neurons and &#8220;get the most out of the cells that are there,&#8221; Temple suggests.</p>\n\n<p>Some experts are less impressed by the study. Parabiosis researcher Irina Conboy of the University of California, Berkeley, notes that the paper doesn&#8217;t put the modest memory and learning improvements from TIMP2 in context by comparing them to, say, putting an old mouse on an exercise wheel, which can also improve cognitive function. Her own work suggests that the apparent antiaging effects of young blood may reflect the fact that&#160;<a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/11/22/young-blood-does-not-reverse-aging-in-old-mice-uc-berkeley-study-finds/">it contains less of certain factors in old blood that her lab and others have reported contribute to aging</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Stanford has filed for patents on using TIMP2 to treat aging-associated conditions, and Alkahest, a company in San Carlos, California, that Wyss-Coray co-founded, plans to develop it. An Alkahest-sponsored trial at Stanford testing young human plasma as a treatment in 18 Alzheimer&#8217;s disease patients ended in January; results will be presented at a meeting in November, says Alkahest CEO Karoly Nikolich. (Rubin serves on Alkahest&#8217;s advisory board.) Meanwhile, some clinics are already offering young blood injections&#160;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/08/young-blood-antiaging-trial-raises-questions">to reverse aging in people</a>. But Wyss-Coray and others say such treatments are premature.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Protein isolated from human cord blood has antiaging effects on memory in mice" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

A 2-year study of a population in Belgium, now entirely wiped out, has revealed that these amphibians can\'t develop immunity to the fungus, as was hoped. To make matters worse, it turns out the fungus creates a hardy spore that can survive in water for months and also stick to birds\' feet, offering a way for it to spread rapidly across the continent. Two other kinds of amphibians, both resistant to the disease, also act as carriers for the highly infectious spores.</p>\n\n<p>"This is terrible news," says geneticist Matthew Fisher of Imperial College London, who studies the fungus but was not involved in the new research. "This isn\'t a problem that\'s going to go away. It\'s a problem that\'s going to get worse."</p>\n\n<p>The pathogen, <em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em> (Bsal), is a chytrid fungus, a type that lives in damp or wet environments and typically consumes dead organic matter. Bsal infects and eats the skin of salamanders, causing lesions, apathy, loss of appetite, and eventually death. Over the past few decades, a related fungus, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5783/48"><em>B.&#160;dendrobatidis</em> (Bd), has struck hard at amphibian populations</a> around the world, particularly in the Americas, Australia, Spain, and Portugal. More than 200 species of frogs and toads are thought to have gone extinct, including many kinds of Costa Rica\'s striking stream-breeding toads.</p>\n\n<p>Bsal was identified in a nature reserve in the Netherlands in 2013 after fire salamanders started dying with ulcers and sores similar to those caused by Bd. Fire salamanders (<em>Salamandra salamandra</em>) grow up to 35 centimeters long, can live more than 40 years, and hunt insects and other small prey in forest streams. Their bright yellow spots warn predators of poison around their head and back. In the Dutch nature reserve, the population plummeted 99.9%. The fungus is thought to have arrived in Europe via salamanders or newts imported from Asia for the pet trade. Bsal has since been found in Belgium and Germany in both fire salamanders and alpine newts.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as Bsal was spotted in Belgium in April 2014, veterinarian An Martel of Ghent University&#160;in Merelbeke, Belgium, and her colleagues began visiting every month to track the population. About 90% of the fire salamanders died within 6 months, and after 2 years all were gone. The fieldwork revealed that adult animals were more likely to get infected, which makes sense because they are in closer contact with each other&#8212;through fighting for mating and breeding, for example&#8212;than are juveniles. But the death of these adults means that the population likely won\'t recover.</p>\n\n<p>There was <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature22059">no immune response detected in any of the sick animals in the lab</a>, suggesting that it will be impossible to develop a vaccine, the team reports today in <cite>Nature</cite>. "We really wanted to find solutions to mitigate disease, to save the salamanders, but everything turned out bad," Martel says. The team had also hoped that the fungus would become less virulent&#8212;as often occurs when a pathogen reaches a new host that lacks any immunity&#8212;but that hasn\'t happened: Fungal spores taken from the last fire salamanders in the Belgian forest, when dripped onto the backs of healthy salamanders in the lab, were just as lethal as those collected early in the outbreak. "When they come in contact with a single spore, they will die."</p>\n  \n  <blockquote class="pullquote">\n  \n  \n      <p>This is a very important piece of work, and it\'s terrifying. &#8230;&#160;If [this] gets loose in the United States, it\'s going to be bad.</p>\n  \n  <footer>\n  \n      Joe Mendelson, Zoo Atlanta  \n</footer>\n</blockquote>\n\n  \n  \n      <p>The paper has more bad news. Researchers knew that Bsal makes spores with a tiny tail called a flagellum, which propels them toward amphibians. If spores dry out, they die. Otherwise, they typically survive for a few days before being eaten by protozoa. But Martel\'s group discovered that Bsal makes a second type of spore that looks much hardier and is rarely eaten by protozoa. "This will make it almost impossible to eradicate the fungus from the environment," says Martel, who adds that the spores can survive in pond water for more than 2 months.</p>\n\n<p>Another experiment showed that soil remained infectious for 48 hours after it was walked on by a sick salamander. In a separate lab test, the spores adhered to goose feet, suggesting they could hitchhike long distances on birds.</p>\n\n<p>The group also showed that two species that share the same habitat as the fire salamander are likely carriers of the disease. Midwife toads (<em>Alytes obstetricans</em>) could be infected with the fungus and shed spores for a few weeks, but they didn\'t get sick. A high dose of the fungus killed alpine newts (<em>Ichthyosaura alpestris</em>), but low doses made them infectious for months without killing them. As has happened with Bd in the Americas, Bsal will lurk in these reservoirs of disease even after local populations of fire salamanders vanish. Any fire salamanders that arrive from elsewhere will likely get infected by newts or toads.&#160;&#160;</p>\n  \n  <div class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-image">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ERRYR6-hires_16x9.jpg?itok=Wllbow77" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ERRYR6-hires_16x9.jpg?itok=Wllbow77 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/ERRYR6-hires_16x9.jpg?itok=_fM0PH9l 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption">\n  \n      <p>Midwife toads, known for carrying their eggs on their back, can spread the fungus while infected, but they don\'t get sick.</p>\n  \n</div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      Tierfotoagentur/Alamy Stock Photo  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n  \n  \n      <p>According to results from&#160;<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/630">previous infection trials</a>, most salamander species in Europe are likely just as vulnerable to Bsal. The fire salamander has a range that extends across Europe, and the fear is that the fungus will reach endangered salamanders. With small populations, these species could more easily be driven extinct, Fisher says. "The assumption is that they are all at risk," he says, and the findings in the new paper "have really upped their risk status." Martel and European colleagues recently started monitoring for Bsal in seven countries.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible to cure amphibians in the lab. For animals that can take the heat, like fire salamanders, 10 days at 25&#176;C will kill the fungus. Other species can be cured with a combination of two drugs. But there is no practical solution for animals in the wild, especially when their habitat is contaminated with fungal spores.</p>\n\n<p>Herpetologist Jaime Bosch of the National Museum of Natural History in Madrid had a rare success in eliminating a chytrid fungus from the wild. A few years ago, he and colleagues got <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/11/biologists-wipe-out-toad-killing-fungus-spanish-island">rid of Bd on the Spanish island of Mallorca</a> by temporarily removing some 2000 tadpoles of the Mallorcan midwife toad (<em>Alytes muletensis</em>) and disinfecting their ponds with powerful chemicals. But this success would be hard to replicate in less isolated locations, he says. "Right now, we are very far away from having any solution." The only hope in the meantime, Bosch and others say, is to slow the spread of the disease by ending the importation of amphibians.</p>\n\n<p>The United States, a hot spot of amphibian diversity, has already taken steps in that direction. Last year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="https://www.fws.gov/injuriouswildlife/salamanders.html">banned the import of 201 species of salamanders</a> on the grounds that they might introduce the fungus. Joe Mendelson, a herpetologist at Zoo Atlanta, says the new research suggests the list should be expanded to include other carriers such as the toad and newt studied in the new paper. "This is a very important piece of work, and it\'s terrifying," he says. "If Bsal gets loose in the United States," he says, "it\'s going to be bad."</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="A deadly salamander disease just got a lot scarier " class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Service</a><time>Apr. 19, 2017 , 1:45 PM</time></p>\n</header><p>Martin Burke is a tad envious. A chemist at the University of Illinois in Urbana, Burke has watched funding agencies back major research initiatives in other fields. Biologists pulled in billions of dollars to decipher the human genome, and physicists persuaded governments to fund the gargantuan Large Hadron Collider, which discovered the Higgs boson. Meanwhile chemists, divided among dozens of research areas, often wind up fighting for existing funds.</p>\n\n<p>Burke wants to change that. At the American Chemical Society (ACS) meeting here earlier this month, he proposed that chemists rally around an initiative to synthesize most of the hundreds of thousands of known organic natural products: the diverse small molecules made by microbes, plants, and animals. "It would be a moon mission for our field," Burke says. The effort, which would harness an automated synthesis machine he and his colleagues developed to snap together molecules from a set of premade building blocks, could cost $1 billion and take 20 years, Burke estimates. But the idea captivates at least some in the field. "Assuming it\'s a robust technology, I would have to think it would be revolutionary," says John Reed, the global head of pharma research and early development at Roche in Basel, Switzerland. "Even if it only allowed you to make half the compounds, it strikes me as worthy."</p>\n\n<p>Natural products have countless uses in modern society. They make up more than half of all medicines, as well as dyes, diagnostic probes, perfumes, sweeteners, lotions, and so on. "There\'s probably not a home on the planet that has not been impacted by natural products," Burke says.</p>\n\n<p>But discovering, isolating, and testing new natural products is slow, painstaking work. Take bryostatins, a family of 20 natural products first isolated in 1976 from spongelike marine creatures called bryozoans. Bryostatins have shown potential for treating Alzheimer\'s disease and HIV, and demand has skyrocketed. Yet chemists must mash up 14 tons of bryozoans to produce just 18 grams of bryostatin-1. Synthesizing new bryostatins is equally hard, each one requiring dozens of chemical steps.</p>\n\n<p>Burke thinks there is a better way. Two years ago, he and colleagues unveiled a machine <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6227/1190">that can link a variety of building blocks Lego-wise to create thousands of natural product compounds and their structural relatives</a>. Now he says the approach can be scaled up. Molecular biologists have already automated the synthesis of short strands of DNA, proteins, and sugar chains, revolutionizing biomedicine. Burke argues that doing the same for natural products "could have major positive implications not just for chemistry, but for society."</p>\n\n<p>Two years ago, Burke estimated that assembling 75% of natural products with his machine would take some 5000 different building blocks, compared with just four for DNA&#8212;a challenging number for chemical suppliers to make and stock. But now, Burke told the ACS meeting, the problem looks more manageable. His lab recently teamed up with that of Jeffrey Skolnick, a computational biologist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. They surveyed the literature on natural products, counted 282,487 compounds, and mapped all their structures. Skolnick\'s team then designed an algorithm to break each one into fragments, snapping only single bonds between carbon atoms&#8212;the kind of bonds Burke\'s machine can reassemble. Then the researchers asked the computer how many unique fragments it would take to reconstruct the library. It turned out that just 1400 building blocks would suffice to synthesize 75% of all natural product "chemical space," which includes related compounds not made by any organism. "This suggests it\'s a bounded, solvable problem," Burke says.</p>\n\n<p>"It\'s a profound idea," says Mukund Chorghade, president of THINQ Pharma in Mumbai, India, who believes it would be a boon for drug discovery because it could provide untold numbers of lead compounds for developing new treatments. But not everyone is sold. "Marty is a visionary," says Larry Overman, a synthetic organic chemist at the University of California, Irvine. However, he says, natural product molecules are vastly more complex in structure than biopolymers such as DNA and proteins, and whether automated synthesizers could reproduce that complexity isn\'t clear.</p>\n\n<p>An even harder problem could be securing funding for a large-scale effort to make the building blocks, assemble them into intermediate structures, and fold and tailor those to produce the final shapes. Bob Lees, head of the division at the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) in Bethesda, Maryland, that supports much of the organic chemical synthesis research in the United States, notes that in recent years NIGMS has devoted less funding to large-scale projects and more to research by single investigators. And last month, the Trump administration\'s initial budget request for 2018 proposed cutting the budget for the National Institutes of Health, the parent organization of NIGMS, by nearly 20%. Whatever its merits, Burke\'s cornucopian vision could face a steep uphill climb to become reality.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Billion-dollar project would synthesize hundreds of thousands of molecules in search of new medicines" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Just imagine what scientists could see if they could also <em>make</em> things bigger. A new strategy to blow brains up does just that. Researchers previously invented a method for injecting a polyacrylate mesh into brain tissue, the same water-absorbing and expanding molecule that makes dirty diapers swell up. Just add water, and the tissue enlarges to 4.5 times its original size. But it wasn&#8217;t good enough to see everything. The brain is full of diminutive protrusions called dendritic spines lining the signal receiving end of a neuron. Hundreds to thousands of these nubs help strengthen or weaken an individual dendrite&#8217;s connection to other neurons in the brain. The nanoscale size of these spines makes studying them with light microscopes impossible or blurry at best, however. Now, the same group has overcome this barrier in an improved method called iterative expansion microscopy, described today in <em>Nature Methods</em>. Here, the tissue is expanded once, the crosslinked mesh is cleaved, and then the tissue is expanded again, <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nmeth.4261">resulting in roughly 20-fold enlargement</a>. Neurons are then visualized by light-emitting molecules linked to antibodies which latch onto specified proteins. The technique has yielded detailed images showing the formation of proteins along synapses in mice, as well as detailed renderings of dendritic spines (seen in the image above) in the mouse hippocampus&#8212;a center or learning and memory in the brain. The advance could enable neuroscientists to map the many individual connections between neurons across the brain and the unique arrangement of receptors that turn brain circuits on and off.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="By blowing up brain tissue to 20 times its size, scientists see unprecedented details " class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

By carefully chipping away at the end of a chalky tube (seen in photo above), researchers found a long, black, wormlike mass oozing from its casing&#8212;the first live specimen of the giant shipworm <em>Kuphus polythalamia</em>. The animal&#8217;s length makes it the longest of any living bivalve, a class of typically small critters including clams, oysters, and scallops. And as far as shipworms go, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6276/901.full">which usually burrow into and feed on wood</a> from ships or sunken trees, <em>K. polythalamia</em> is unique for squatting down and making a home in ocean mud. A look at their digestive tracts indicates that <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1620470114">these creatures don&#8217;t eat&#8212;or poop&#8212;a whole lot</a>, the researchers report today in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Wood-munching microbes on the sea floor expel hydrogen sulfide, the molecule responsible for the distinctive smell of rotting eggs. A different set of microbes living in the gills of <em>K. polythalamia</em> uses this hydrogen sulfide as an energy source to make carbon molecules that help sustain their shipworm host. The researchers suggest that studying the shipworms&#8217; transition from eating wood to relying on sulfur might help illuminate the evolution of animals such as deep sea mussels and giant tube worms that consume hydrogen sulfide from hydrothermal vents on deep ocean sea floors.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Giant shipworms discovered hiding in sulfurous lagoons" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

"You normally cannot hear me anyway," jokes the physicist at the start of a talk this past December at CERN, the particle physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, while a technician fiddles with his microphone.</p>\n\n<p>Ting may be soft-spoken, but few would call him retiring. Two decades ago, Ting persuaded funders to spend $1.5 billion to build the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS). In 2011, NASA launched the 8.5-metric-ton magnet on the penultimate space shuttle flight and attached it to the International Space Station (ISS). Now he is capturing attention again, with a hint&#8212;buried at the end of his talk&#8212;that the AMS is finally delivering on the promise of its original name, when "AM" stood for "antimatter."</p>\n\n<p>So far, the AMS has measured the masses and electric charges of some 90 billion particles that have passed through the magnet\'s maw. Nearly all of those are protons and helium nuclei, along with a smattering of electrons and nuclei of carbon, oxygen, and iron. A precious few are antiprotons and positrons: the antimatter counterparts of protons and electrons. To Ting, those antiparticles may be clues to the unseen "dark matter" that weighs down galaxies with extra gravity, although many astrophysicists regard them as the byproduct of humdrum galactic events.</p>\n\n<p>Those antiparticles are not Ting\'s big news, however. At CERN, and again in a 16 February talk at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, where he has worked since 1969, Ting says that the AMS may have trapped a bigger and weirder form of antimatter. The AMS, he says, has seen a handful of candidate particles of antihelium-3, made of two antiprotons and an antineutron. In labs on Earth, physicists have made antihelium for a few fleeting instants, but no one has ever detected it in space.</p>\n\n<p>"It was shocking," says physicist Michael Salamon, AMS project manager at the Department of Energy (DOE) in Washington, D.C., who heard about the results when Ting called him during a vacation. It\'s so unexpected that Ting says he has refrained from publishing the finding or even asking theorists what might be going on. "I want to make sure the signal is genuine," he tells <em>Science.</em> Detecting antihelium in nature could shake up cosmology. A single confirmed detection could indicate the existence of islands of antimatter that have survived since the big bang, or point to particle interactions beyond the standard model of physics. And for Ting, who turned 81 in January, it would be a vindication, a final retort to his strident critics.</p>\n\n<p>In 1976, Ting shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering a subatomic particle called the J/Psi meson. It was 1994 when he first proposed using the AMS to take the particle hunt to space. He promptly drew flak. Some contended that the project, funded by international partners and DOE, had won support through savvy political maneuvering instead of a normal scientific review, and that it wouldn\'t deliver big insights. Ting\'s results so far amount to "physics by press conference," says Greg Tarl&#233;, an astrophysicist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and a vocal critic of Ting and the AMS.</p>\n\n<p>Ting\'s marquee AMS result&#8212;that more high-energy positrons than expected are buzzing around the galaxy&#8212;has not impressed the doubters. That positron excess, which a European satellite found in the mid-2000s and the AMS confirmed, has sparked hundreds of theory papers connecting it to hypothetical dark matter particles. The mutual annihilation of those particles might create a half-and-half blend of electrons and positrons in a narrow energy range. The electrons would fade into a sea of electrons from other sources, but the rarer positrons might stand out. To Ting, the best explanation for the extra positrons is a dark matter particle with a mass of 1 teraelectronvolt&#8212;about as much energy as a flying mosquito.</p>\n\n<p>Other researchers favor more familiar astrophysical sources. The proliferation of dark matter models, including those that Ting points to, "maybe has more to do with communities and how fast they write papers than it does with science," says Tim Linden, a particle astrophysicist at The Ohio State University in Columbus. He and others note that the Milky Way is a messy laboratory, roiling with pulsars&#8212;the spinning, highly magnetic cores of collapsed stars&#8212;and supernovas, which accelerate protons to ultrahigh energies and send them slamming into cooler gas. Both phenomena could generate the antimatter that the AMS sees.</p>\n  \n  <div id="paragraph-bundle-2753" class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-markup">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="graphic entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-figure align-right"><h3 class="graphic__header">What\'s the matter?</h3>\n <div class="graphic__body">\n<p>Perched on the International Space Station, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer since 2011 has studied the charged particles that pass through its doughnut-shaped magnet.

There are few conceivable ways for conventional astrophysical processes or dark matter particles to generate that much antihelium, says Kerstin Perez, a particle astrophysicist at MIT. She is co-leading a balloon experiment that could search for antihelium when it launches over Antarctica in 2020. "If it\'s real," she says of Ting\'s claim, "it\'s something fundamentally new."</p>\n\n<p>It also would validate Ting\'s original proposal. When Ting sold NASA and DOE on the AMS, he said it might find runaway particles from oases of antimatter, helping solve a deep riddle. The big bang produced matter and antimatter in equal amounts. Soon after, they began colliding and annihilating each other in puffs of gamma rays. But somehow, matter came to dominate the observable universe. That could be because of some fundamental difference between the two&#8212;or maybe it was just a coin flip, where certain regions of space came to be ruled by one or the other. Ting\'s idea to look for those regions galvanized his critics, who considered it outlandish because clumps of antimatter coexisting with normal galaxies would produce more gamma radiation than astronomers observe. Moreover, large antiparticles could not easily survive the journey to the AMS. But if antimatter were there, the AMS would sniff it out&#8212;or so the original pitch went.</p>\n\n<p>The feeling both inside and outside of the AMS team, though, is that it\'s still far too early to rule out a more mundane explanation: a problem in the detector. As charged particles pass through the doughnut-shaped magnet, its field bends their paths into signature curves that indicate their charge and momentum. The particles arc through nine cooled-down silicon detectors that track the curves. About a billion times a year the particle turns out to be a helium nucleus, with two positive charges. But each year has also brought one event or so that for all the world looks like it is curving with charge equal to minus two, Ting says&#8212;the expected signature of antihelium. The events could just be heliums bouncing unusually off an atom inside the experiment, leading to a misidentification. But the team has used computers to model all the possible paths a particle could take in the detector. "We still do not see any possible way this could come from any background," Ting says. "Many people in the collaboration think we should publish it."</p>\n\n<p>That he hasn\'t done so yet is typical of Ting, his supporters say. "That is kind of his trademark, so to speak , to be extremely sure when something comes out," says Philip von Doetinchem of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, who is a member of the AMS team but has not worked on the antihelium problem. But critics see it differently. "He knows that he has an instrumental problem," Tarl&#233; says. To Tarl&#233;, Ting is strategically playing coy to drum up further support for the mission.</p>\n\n<p>And Ting may need it. DOE, which will review the AMS in 2019, is impatient for breakthroughs&#8212;not routine astrophysics. "Understanding the spectra of particular species of cosmic rays is good to know, but it\'s not as important, quite frankly," Salamon says. A more pressing concern is that just one of four redundant pumps that cool its silicon trackers is working at full strength.</p>\n\n<p>If the AMS can last until 2024, when the United States and other nations plan to stop funding the ISS, the magnet should be able to double its census of particles. Achieving that would not only help differentiate between exotic and mundane interpretations of its positron signals but also could give Ting more antihelium candidates. Ting won\'t say whether having 10 or more will provide the statistical power required to call this a discovery, but he says each one helps.</p>\n\n<p>Ting says he is planning to replace the broken pumps with a new system that astronauts would install during a spacewalk. A NASA spokesperson confirms that planning for the repair is underway, in case the last pump breaks. The agency has devoted $16 million to possible spacewalks between now and 2019. DOE and Ting\'s international partners have already purchased the replacement parts, he says. "There\'s no money issue," Ting says.</p>\n\n<p>If, after all these years, the AMS falls short of finding antihelium, it won\'t be for lack of trying.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Giant space magnet may have trapped antihelium, raising idea of lingering pools of antimatter in the cosmos" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

But&#8212;as even they will tell you&#8212;they&#8217;re no match for the complexity of the human body. Heart attacks in particular are hard to anticipate. Now, scientists have shown that computers capable of teaching themselves can perform even better than standard medical guidelines, significantly increasing prediction rates. If implemented, the new method could save thousands or even millions of lives a year.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stress enough how important it is,&#8221; says Elsie Ross, a vascular surgeon at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved with the work, &#8220;and how much I really hope that doctors start to embrace the use of artificial intelligence to assist us in care of patients.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Each year, nearly 20 million people die from the effects of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks, strokes, blocked arteries, and other circulatory system malfunctions. In an effort to predict these cases, many doctors use guidelines similar to those of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA). Those are based on eight risk factors&#8212;including age, cholesterol level, and blood pressure&#8212;that physicians effectively add up.</p>\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s too simplistic to account for the many medications a patient might be on, or other disease and lifestyle factors. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of interaction in biological systems,&#8221; says Stephen Weng, an epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Some of those interactions are counterintuitive: A lot of body fat can actually protect against heart disease in some cases. &#8220;That&#8217;s the reality of the human body,&#8221; Weng says. &#8220;What computer science allows us to do is to explore those associations.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>In the new study, Weng and his colleagues compared use of the ACC/AHA guidelines with four machine-learning algorithms: random forest, logistic regression, gradient boosting, and neural networks. All four techniques analyze lots of data in order to come up with predictive tools without any human instruction. In this case, the data came from the electronic medical records of 378,256 patients in the United Kingdom. The goal was to find patterns in the records that were associated with cardiovascular events.</p>\n\n<p>First, the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms had to train themselves. They used about 78% of the data&#8212;some 295,267 records&#8212;to search for patterns and build their own internal &#8220;guidelines.&#8221; They then tested themselves on the remaining records. Using record data available in 2005, they predicted which patients would have their first cardiovascular event over the next 10 years, and checked the guesses against the 2015 records. Unlike the ACC/AHA guidelines, the machine-learning methods were allowed to take into account 22 more data points, including ethnicity, arthritis, and kidney disease.</p>\n\n<p>All four AI methods performed significantly better than the ACC/AHA guidelines. Using a statistic called AUC (in which a score of 1.0 signifies 100% accuracy), the ACC/AHA guidelines hit 0.728. The four new methods ranged from 0.745 to 0.764, Weng&#8217;s team reports this month in <cite>PLOS ONE</cite>. The best one&#8212;neural networks&#8212;correctly predicted 7.6% more events than the ACC/AHA method, and it raised 1.6% fewer false alarms. In the test sample of about 83,000 records, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0174944">that amounts to 355 additional patients whose lives could have been saved</a>. That&#8217;s because prediction often leads to prevention, Weng says, through cholesterol-lowering medication or changes in diet.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;This is high-quality work,&#8221; says Evangelos Kontopantelis, a data scientist at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom who works with primary care databases. He says that dedicating more computational power or more training data to the problem &#8220;could have led to even bigger gains.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Several of the risk factors that the machine-learning algorithms identified as the strongest predictors are not included in the ACC/AHA guidelines, such as severe mental illness and taking oral corticosteroids. Meanwhile, none of the algorithms considered diabetes, which is on the ACC/AHA list, to be among the top 10 predictors. Going forward, Weng hopes to include other lifestyle and genetic factors in computer algorithms to further improve their accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>Kontopantelis notes one limitation to the work: <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/brainlike-computers-are-black-box-scientists-are-finally-peering-inside">Machine-learning algorithms are like black boxes</a>, in that you can see the data that go&#160;in and the decision that comes out, but you can&#8217;t grasp what happens in between. That makes it difficult for humans to tweak the algorithm, and it thwarts predictions of what it will do in a new scenario.</p>\n\n<p>Will physicians soon adopt similar machine-learning methods in their practices? Doctors really pride themselves on their expertise, Ross says. &#8220;But I, being part of a newer generation, see that we can be assisted by the computer.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Self-taught artificial intelligence beats doctors at predicting heart attacks" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Trees are important for timber, food, and medicine, but getting a handle on the world&#8217;s thousands of tree species is a tough task. Up until this year, there\'s been no complete census. Now, researchers have published the first global database of tree species and their geographical ranges, a &#8220;huge scientific effort,&#8221; the team reports in the <em>Journal of Sustainable Forestry</em>. The scientists compiled the searchable online&#160;<a href="https://www.bgci.org/global_tree_search.php">archive</a>, which includes over 60,000 tree species, using data from a variety of sources such as museums, botanical gardens, and agricultural institutions. They found that Brazil, Colombia, and Indonesia were the <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10549811.2017.1310049">countries with the most tree species</a>&#8212;each is home to at least 5000. And nearly 60% of the world&#8217;s trees are native to just one country, the team noted. This database, which will be continuously updated, should allow researchers, policymakers, and the public to better monitor tree diversity and efforts to conserve specific species in forests, the scientists suggest. It will also form the basis of the Global Tree Assessment, an effort to document the conservation status of each tree species before the end of the decade.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="How many tree species are there?

They also use a wide range of cues to find their way home, including <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/01/scienceshot-homing-pigeons-follow-their-noses">smell</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/10/one-eyed-pigeons-still-use-sight-find-their-way-home">sight</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/01/sound-maps-may-help-pigeons-navigate">sound</a>, and <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/205/4410/1027">magnetism</a>. On its own, a pigeon released multiple times from the same place will even modify its navigation over time for a more optimal route home. The birds also learn specific routes from one another. Because flocks of pigeons tend to take more direct flights home than individuals, scientists have long thought some sort of &#8220;collective intelligence&#8221; is at work.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>But can pigeons improve this homing ability over generations, building on the knowledge of birds that have come before? The phenomenon, known as cumulative cultural evolution, was considered &#8220;arguably unique to humans,&#8221; says Dora Biro, a behavioral biologist at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>To find out if birds share this ability, Biro and Oxford biologist Takao Sasaki strapped GPS devices on homing pigeons and divided them into three groups: birds homing by themselves, birds flying with the same partner, and birds that switched up their partner every half dozen flights or so.</p>\n\n<p>He and Biro based their design on the famous &#8220;spaghetti tower&#8221; test. In that experiment, one person was asked to build a tower as high as possible using raw spaghetti and clay while an observer looked on. Then, the builder left and the observer was asked to build a tower in front of a new observer. Researchers found that 10 &#8220;generations&#8221; of observers each built towers similar to the ones before them, but taller, demonstrating the basic idea of standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of building towers, the pigeons simply had to fly home, an instinctive behavior. Birds in all three groups improved in the first few flights home, but after that, only the group in which the most experienced bird was periodically switched out <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms15049">continued to get closer to the perfect route</a>, the researchers report today in <em>Nature Communications</em>. The new bird in the pair was the equivalent of the observer in the spaghetti tower experiment and represented the &#8220;next generation&#8221; that learned from and built upon the experienced bird&#8217;s knowledge. &#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I think the paper convincingly shows that animal groups can show both collective intelligence and cumulative culture,&#8221; says Harvard University animal behaviorist Albert Kao, who was not affiliated with the study. A na&#239;ve bird does not develop a completely new route, but instead changes an existing route that it acquires from a bird in the previous generation&#8212;and that&#8217;s a hallmark of cumulative culture, Biro adds.</p>\n\n<p>Still, not everyone is convinced. &#8220;I like the paper. It is carefully&#8212;even beautifully&#8212;done, but I think this question of whether animals can and do have cumulative culture is still open,&#8221; says Claudio Tennie, a comparative psychologist at the University of T&#252;bingen in Germany who was not involved with the work. He argues that the pigeons are not really learning a new behavior, and thus the birds demonstrate just a subtype of cumulative culture.</p>\n\n<p>Maxime Derex, an evolutionary anthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe, agrees. Cumulative culture is more complex in humans, he says. We&#8217;ve gone from the spoken to the written word and now to ever more sophisticated electronics to communicate, he notes, whereas all the birds show is that they can improve their route home.</p>\n\n<p>Biro and Sasaki accept this difference between pigeons and humans. &#8220;But our study demonstrates that nonhuman animals can accumulate knowledge and improve performance over generations, satisfying the criteria for cumulative cultural evolution,&#8221; Sasaki says. &#8220;Thus, our results suggest that [this ability] may not require sophisticated cognition as previously thought.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Think only humans can build on the knowledge of previous generations?

Researchers continue to track the wolves and their moose prey, in the last installments of the world&#8217;s <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/340/6135/919">longest running predator-prey study</a>.&#160; They report today that although the wolves hunt successfully, they are too few to affect the moose population. Aquatic as well as terrestrial vegetation is taking a hit as moose numbers climb, according to <a href="http://isleroyalewolf.org/wolfhome/ann_rep.html">the study&#8217;s 59<sup>th</sup> annual report</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After Canadian wolves colonized the island in 1949, the wolf population peaked at 50 in 1980, and<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/340/6135/919"> as recently as a decade ago, 30 wolves prowled the island</a>, a U.S. National Park. The island&#8217;s now-famous predator-prey study has tracked how wolf and moose numbers have risen and fallen in tandem over the decades, and left their mark on the island&#8217;s ecology.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>In contrast to&#160;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/extreme-inbreeding-likely-spells-doom-isle-royale-wolves">last year&#8217;s winter study</a>, when wolf tracks were the only evidence of the predators, wildlife ecologist Rolf Peterson spotted both wolves sitting on lake ice on the January afternoon he arrived on the island.&#160; Weeks later, Peterson and co-investigator John Vucetich, both of Michigan Technological University in Houghton, found the wolves feeding on a freshly-killed moose calf. &#8220;We were very lucky,&#8221; Peterson says. &#8220;There was no mystery left in terms of the wolf population,&#8221; or what they were eating.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>The researchers also observed that, in what normally would have been the wolves&#8217; breeding period, the 7-year-old female bared her teeth in response to the close interest of the 9-year-old male; he is both her father and half sibling.&#160; Researchers don&#8217;t expect the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article-abstract/108/2/120/2667696/Genomic-Variation-of-Inbreeding-and-Ancestry-in">highly inbred pair</a> to reproduce.</p>\n\n<p>The two wolves otherwise appeared healthy and still have all their canines, a key sign of well-being in the carnivores. The pair has already surpassed the average Isle Royale wolf lifespan of 4 years, dodging the main causes of death for their ancestors on the island: other wolves and starvation. &#8220;They are swimming in moose,&#8221; Vucetich says.</p>\n\n<p>The four wolf-killed carcasses the researchers spotted made little dent in the overall moose population, estimated at 1600 in aerial surveys conducted this past winter.&#160; The 20% increase from last winter is consistent with the population&#8217;s growth rate over the past 6 years, as <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/04/inbred-wolf-population-isle-royale-collapses">the inbred wolf population dwindled and collapsed</a>.&#160; Both beaver and moose abundance have tripled since 2011, &#8220;undoubtedly because of lack of predation,&#8221; Vucetich says.</p>\n\n<p>With moose density on the Guam-sized island already five to ten times higher than on the mainland--and with the numbers on track to double in three to four years&#8212;browsing on the island&#8217;s vegetation is intense. One aquatic plant, floating watershield (<em>Brassenia&#160; schreberi</em>), which was abundant six years ago when moose were at historic lows, now thrives in ponds only where moose are excluded. &#8220;It&#8217;s the aquatic equivalent of deforestation,&#8221; says plant ecologist Eric Hellquist of SUNY Oswego, noting that moose&#8217;s effect on aquatic vegetation is not as well studied as that on terrestrial plants. Isle Royale&#8217;s ponds are demonstrating &#8220;how apex predators can have cascading effects on food webs.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n<p>As the effects of the missing predators ripple through the island, the Park Service is assessing about 5000 public comments on <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/12/reversal-us-park-service-aims-move-new-wolves-isle-royale">its proposal to introduce 20 to 30 wolves</a> to the island to establish a new population. The next steps on that plan are expected by the end of this year.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Two wolves survive in world&#8217;s longest running predator-prey study " class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Bad teeth</h1>  <p class="byline byline--article">\n  By <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/author/virginia-morell">Virginia Morell</a><time>Apr. 19, 2017 , 5:00 AM</time></p>\n</header><p>In 1898, two male African lions killed 35 people in the Tsavo region of Kenya. Their 9-month reign of terror ended when Colonel John Patterson of the British Army shot them dead. Scientists have long debated why the lions began eating people. Now, two researchers have a new answer: They blame tooth decay for the big cats&#8217; taste for human flesh. The finding might also explain why other lions sometimes turn into human eaters.</p>\n\n<p>Lions normally consume a diverse variety of animals, including buffalo, wildebeest, giraffe, zebra, and antelope. Humans figure into their diets only rarely. In the 3 months before their deaths, however, the Tsavo human eaters <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2009/11/body-count-two-man-eating-lions">got nearly 30% of their food from people</a>, according to one recent study. Did the lions focus on humans because they were desperate? Many scientists think so. Apparently suffering from starvation&#8212;likely because drought or disease had ravaged their usual prey&#8212;they turned to another toothsome delicacy.</p>\n\n<p>But other researchers have turned up conflicting evidence. Larisa DeSantis, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, wanted a look at the lion&#8217;s preserved teeth after reading a frightful passage from Patterson&#8217;s 1907 account, <em>The Man-Eaters of Tsavo</em>: &#8220;I have a very vivid recollection of one particular night when the brutes seized a man from the railway camp and brought him close to my camp to devour. I could plainly hear them crunching the bones, and the sound &#8230; rang in my ears for days afterwards.&#8221; If the lions were that hungry, DeSantis reasoned, they must have also scavenged carcasses, a process that involves heavy bone crunching and wears down the teeth in predictable patterns.</p>\n  \n  <div class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-image">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/cc_Skull-of-first-Tsavo-man-eater2%2C-by-Bruce-Patterson-and-JP-Brown%2C-The-Field-Museum_16x9.jpg?itok=fCfEMvah" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/cc_Skull-of-first-Tsavo-man-eater2%2C-by-Bruce-Patterson-and-JP-Brown%2C-The-Field-Museum_16x9.jpg?itok=fCfEMvah 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/cc_Skull-of-first-Tsavo-man-eater2%2C-by-Bruce-Patterson-and-JP-Brown%2C-The-Field-Museum_16x9.jpg?itok=7ADY3jDR 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption">\n  \n      <p>The skull of one of the Tsavo&#160;man-eating lions</p>\n  \n</div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      Bruce Patterson and JP Brown &#169; The Field Museum  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n  \n  \n      <p>To find out, she and a colleague analyzed the lions&#8217; jaws and teeth, as well as those of a third human eater from Zambia&#8212;all stored at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois. They used a technique that can determine whether an animal is eating mostly flesh, bones, or some combination of the two. They then compared the patterns on the human eaters&#8217; teeth with those of 53 wild lion specimens from across Africa, two from India, and five captive lions. Next, the scientists examined the patterns on the teeth of cheetahs, which dine solely on flesh, and hyenas, which typically consume entire carcasses&#8212;including the bones.</p>\n\n<p>The Tsavo lions&#8217; teeth did not look like those of hyenas, DeSantis says. Instead, the wear patterns were &#8220;strikingly similar&#8221; to those of the zoo lions, which eat soft foods such as beef and horsemeat. She thinks Patterson was actually hearing the sounds of hyenas that dreadful night.</p>\n\n<p>Other research points out why the lions&#8217; dining preference shifted. One lion&#8212;the one that ate the most flesh&#8212;was known from a previous study to suffer from dental disease. A painful abscess at the root of one of his canines would have made normal hunting&#8212;grabbing and suffocating large prey&#8212;impossible, DeSantis says. His partner also had dental and jaw injuries, but these were less serious. The Zambian human eater, which did not consume bone, was also suffering from severe damage to its jaws. Together, this means that dental injuries and disease likely <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00948-5">led these lions to softer foods</a>, the researchers write today in <cite>Scientific Reports</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;[This] provides first-hand information straight from the lions&#8217; teeth that there is little evidence to support bone eating by the Tsavo lions,&#8221; says Jack Tseng, a vertebrate paleontologist at the State University of New York in&#160;Buffalo&#160;who was not involved in the study. &#8220;Any human bone consumption at the time was much more likely the work of the usual suspects&#8212;hyenas&#8212;than meat-specializing felines.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>But the scientists emphasize that bad teeth alone do not make lions into human eaters. &#8220;[They] probably targeted humans because they were easy and had soft flesh,&#8221; says DeSantis, noting that the cats didn&#8217;t consume entire carcasses. They were also doing what lions do best: hunting opportunistically from a menu that has, since the emergence of early humans, occasionally included people.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Why did these lions eat 35 men?

Slap it in front of a unit of concentration, such as molar, and it means that something exists in an extraordinarily small amount&#8212;think one part per quintillion. That&#8217;s the realm of SHERLOCK, a new diagnostic system that can detect attomolar levels of viruses in a sample and also distinguish Zika from its close relative, dengue. This exquisitely sensitive and specific tool promises to help detect diseases that other diagnostics miss, and it&#8217;s simple and cheap to use. Sexier still, it exploits a variation of CRISPR, the genome-editing method that has become the rage in biology.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very nice work and very well done,&#8221; says Erik Sontheimer, an RNA specialist who did early CRISPR work and is at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester. Harvard University&#8217;s George Church, who co-founded a CRISPR therapeutics company with one of SHERLOCK&#8217;s inventors but is not involved with this work, sums up his reaction in one word: &#8220;Wow.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Scientists recognized as early as 2010 that they might be able to transform CRISPR into a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2976250/">virus detection device</a>. But earlier efforts at making a viral detector became overshadowed by <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/topic/crispr">CRISPR&#8217;s wild success at editing genomes</a>. In those CRISPR applications, scientists fashion a short strip of RNA that guides a DNA-cutting enzyme called Cas9 to precise locations anywhere in a genome. The CRISPR-Cas9 scissors can cripple genes or make way for labs to add new DNA at the point of the cut, which has launched a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/how-battle-lines-over-crispr-were-drawn">billion-dollar industry</a> searching for new medicines and improved crops&#8212;and sparked serious <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/12/inside-summit-human-gene-editing-reporter-s-notebook">ethical debates</a> about the potential to enhance humans.</p>\n\n<p>SHERLOCK differs from the CRISPR-Cas9 system in fundamental ways. It uses an RNA guide that gloms onto RNA, not DNA, and an enzyme called Cas13a cuts the genetic material. Once Cas13a snips the target, it starts indiscriminately cutting any RNA it encounters. A team lead by bioengineer James Collins and CRISPR genome-editing pioneer Feng Zhang, both from the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has now shown that these &#8220;collateral&#8221; cuts can form the basis for the SHERLOCK diagnostic. &#8220;Nature has a lot of very amazing tools,&#8221; Zhang says. The researchers demonstrate that SHERLOCK can detect viral and bacterial infections, cancer mutations found at low frequencies, and subtle DNA sequence variations known as single nucleotide polymorphisms that are linked to other diseases. (SHERLOCK, a somewhat strained acronym coined by the team, stands for specific high sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking.)</p>\n\n<p>To exploit SHERLOCK for detecting small amounts of virus, the researchers spiked samples containing Zika or dengue virus with so-called fluorescent reporter RNA. When this RNA is cut, it effectively shoots off fluorescent flares. The team then unleashed Cas13a connected to a bit of RNA that targeted genetic sequences from either Zika or dengue. Once Cas13a found and sliced even a few viral sequences, it subsequently snipped the fluorescent reporters and created a detectable signal indicating the presence of the virus, the team <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aam9321">reports today</a> in <cite>Science</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers jiggered the system to also make it work on DNA targets&#8212;including cancer mutations in human genomes&#8212;by using enzymes that convert them to RNA. &#8220;It works great for both types of nucleic acid,&#8221; says Broad bioengineer and first author Jonathan Gootenberg, stressing that the real advantage of Cas13a is that it has the collateral activity and can trigger the fluorescent reporter.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;There are exciting opportunities to use such systems for diagnostics in the future,&#8221; says Jennifer Doudna, a structural biologist at the University of California (UC), Berkeley, who helped lead a team that <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6096/816.long">first showed</a> in 2012 how CRISPR-Cas9 could edit DNA. (UC is in a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/round-one-crispr-patent-legal-battle-goes-broad-institute">pitched patent battle</a> with the Broad over those initial discoveries.) In 2011, Doudna co-founded a company to focus on creating diagnostics with CRISPR&#8212;it was <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=9260752&amp;OS=9260752&amp;RS=9260752">awarded a patent</a> for this&#8212;but it now mainly pursues genome engineering. A study Doudna co-authored that <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v538/n7624/full/nature19802.html">appeared last year</a> in <em>Nature </em>described how Cas13 could be used as a sensitive detection system with a fluorescent RNA reporter, but it did not go into the detail of the new work. &#8220;It&#8217;s gratifying to see that this new paper builds on our core idea of using [Cas13] to detect transcripts, and that our results were so helpful to their engineering efforts,&#8221; she says.</p>\n\n<p>The detection sensitivity of the new CRISPR-Cas13a system for specific genetic material is 1 million times better than the most commonly used diagnostic technique, which detects proteins and is known in shorthand as ELISA. It&#8217;s also 1000 times more sensitive than a CRISPR-based Zika virus diagnostic the Collins lab described last year in a <a href="http://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)30505-0"><cite>Cell</cite> paper</a>. SHERLOCK not only makes it easier to find infections or cancer mutations that less sensitive diagnostics can miss, says Collins, but the remarkable attomolar detection ability means the test works far more quickly, too.</p>\n\n<p>A SHERLOCK diagnostic that puts the needed chemicals on a piece of glass fiber paper can be quickly designed for most any RNA or DNA target, made rugged enough for field use, and could cost as little as 61 cents per test, say the study&#8217;s authors. This could greatly help during outbreaks of new infectious diseases, which often occur in poor countries and are difficult to accurately diagnose.</p>\n\n<p>Collins says the Broad is now &#8220;aggressively exploring&#8221; how to commercialize SHERLOCK and may launch a startup company. But before a diagnostic comes to market, it must pass muster at regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="New CRISPR tool can detect tiny amounts of viruses" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Past studies on the spread of certain lifestyle choices&#8212;from altruism to overeating&#8212;have shown that habits can travel like viruses, for good or bad. But this is the first study to rigorously analyze exercise contagion on a large scale. Using fitness tracker data posted to a social site by more than 1 million U.S. runners, researchers analyzed the distances, speeds, and total time they ran, covering 350 million kilometers over 5 years. But how to measure whether social network &#8220;friends&#8221; could influence one another? First, scientists had to tease out confounding effects like the propensity to run more on weekends. So they let the weather set up their experiment, on the understanding that nice weather is likelier to make people run. They found that as people in cities with nice weather went for especially long runs, their friends in unaffected cities would extend their own runs, increasing their running distance and time and burning more calories. That suggests that at least <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms14753">some of that extra exercise is thanks to social influence</a>, the researchers write today in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Men appeared more susceptible than&#160;women: They were strongly affected by male friends and moderately affected by&#160;female friends, whereas women were moderately affected by&#160;other women and unaffected by&#160;men. But less active runners also had an outsized influence on others. As lazier runners put in more time or distance, their friends from afar responded in kind. The&#160;researchers say their findings suggest that to encourage healthy behavior, you should target an entire social&#160;network, not just one individual. After all, what&#8217;s a race with only one person?</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Exercise is contagious, especially if you&#8217;re a man" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Writing a good proposal can take months, and the chances of getting funded are often slim. Funding agencies, meanwhile, spend more and more time and money reviewing growing stacks of applications.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why two researchers are proposing a radically different system that would do away with applications and reviews; instead scientists would just give each other money. &#8220;Self-organized fund allocation&#8221; (SOFA), as it&#8217;s called, was developed by computer scientist Johan Bollen at Indiana University in Bloomington. When he first published about the idea in 2014, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6171/598">many people were skeptical</a>. But interest appears to be growing, and thanks to the work of an enthusiastic advocate, ecologist Marten Scheffer of Wageningen University in the Netherlands, the Dutch parliament adopted a motion last year asking the country&#8217;s main funding agency, the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), to set up a SOFA pilot project.</p>\n\n<p>Competition for funding has become too intense, especially for young scientists, Scheffer and Bollen say, and the current peer-review system is inefficient. It&#8217;s also unfair, they argue, because a few scientists get lots of grants&#8212;Scheffer is one of them&#8212;whereas many others get few or nothing. But when Scheffer explained his idea at an NWO workshop about &#8220;application pressure&#8221; here last week, the agency didn&#8217;t appear sold yet.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>The duo says the numbers speak for themselves. At the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the overall success rate for grants applications has dropped from 30% in 2003 to 19.1% in 2016. In the latest round of European Research Council Starting Grants, the rate was a paltry 11.3%. At NWO, the success rate for grants for young scientists has dropped to 14%. A 2013 study estimated that writing and reviewing applications for &#8364;40 million worth of these grants costs &#8364;9.5 million annually.</p>\n\n<p>In Bollen&#8217;s system, scientists no longer have to apply; instead, they all receive an equal share of the funding budget annually&#8212;some &#8364;30,000 in the Netherlands, and $100,000 in the United States&#8212;but they have to donate a fixed percentage to other scientists whose work they respect and find important. &#8220;Our system is not based on committees&#8217; judgments, but on the wisdom of the crowd,&#8221; Scheffer told the meeting.</p>\n\n<p>Bollen and his colleagues have tested their idea in computer simulations. If scientists allocated 50% of their money to colleagues they cite in their papers, research funds would roughly be distributed the way funding agencies currently do, <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-016-2110-3">they showed in a paper last year</a>&#8212;but at much lower overhead costs.</p>\n\n<p>Not everybody is convinced. At the meeting, some worried that scientists might give money mostly to their friends. Scheffer said an algorithm would prevent that, for instance by banning donations to people you have published with, but he acknowledged it would be a challenge in small research communities. SOFA might also result in a mismatch between what scientists need and what their colleagues donate, and a competition for donations could lead to a time-consuming and costly circus, comparable to an election campaign.</p>\n\n<p>The way to find out, Scheffer and Bollen say, is a real-world test, and they say the Netherlands, a small country with short lines of communication between scientists, politicians, and funding agencies, is a good place for one. Last year, Scheffer convinced Eppo Bruins, a member of the Dutch House of Representatives, to submit a motion calling for a pilot program at NWO, which the parliament approved in June 2016. The money could be taken from a &#8364;150 million NWO pot currently distributed among consortia of innovative Dutch scientists, Bruins suggested.</p>\n\n<p>But NWO is not obliged to carry out the proposal, and so far has shown little enthusiasm. &#8220;NWO is willing to explore together with scientists and other stakeholders how to improve allocation rates, but is still considering practicality and support&#8221; for SOFA, a spokesperson tells <cite>Science</cite>Insider. At last week&#8217;s meeting, NWO President Stan Gielen said the funds Bruins has in mind are distributed by NWO but are earmarked by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, which would have to give permission. Gielen added that any experiment should not come at the expense of existing funding.</p>\n\n<p>Scheffer says he&#8217;s not giving up. It&#8217;s not a risky experiment, he says: &#8220;The money would not be wasted, after all, but just be given to other scientists.&#8221; But he says he understands why NWO is not thrilled: If applied universally, the novel system would make the agency redundant. Perhaps it&#8217;s telling, Scheffer says, that he has not been invited to an <a href="http://www.nwo.nl/en/policies/nwo+conferences+2017/international+conference">international conference on applications and peer review that NWO is organizing in June</a>.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="With this new system, scientists never have to write a grant application again" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

But both approaches require either very humid air or far too much electricity to be broadly useful.</p>\n\n<p>To find an all-purpose solution, researchers led by Omar Yaghi, a chemist at the University of California, Berkeley, turned to a family of crystalline powders called metal organic frameworks, or MOFs. Yaghi developed the first MOFs&#8212;porous crystals that form continuous 3D networks&#8212;more than 20 years ago. The networks assemble in a Tinkertoy-like fashion from metal atoms that act as the hubs and sticklike organic compounds that link the hubs together. By choosing different metals and organics, chemists can dial in the properties of each MOF, controlling what gases bind to them, and how strongly they hold on.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past 2 decades chemists have synthesized more than 20,000 MOFs, each with unique molecule-grabbing properties. For example, Yaghi and others recently designed MOFs that absorb&#8212;and later release&#8212;methane,&#160;<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/538">making them a type of high-capacity gas tank</a>&#160;for natural gas&#8211;powered vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>In 2014, Yaghi and his colleagues synthesized a MOF that excelled at absorbing water, even under low-humidity conditions. That led him to reach out to Evelyn Wang, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, with whom he had previously worked on a project to use MOFs in automobile air conditioning. After synthesizing the new zirconium-based MOF, dubbed MOF-801, Yaghi met Wang at MIT and said, &#8220;Evelyn we have to come up with a water-harvesting device.&#8221; She agreed to give it a shot.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="graphic entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-figure"><h3 class="graphic__header">Device pulls water from the air</h3>\n  <div class="graphic__body">\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At night setup soaks up water vapor from air, and uses heat from the sun to release it as liquid water during the day.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/0413SNOWWaterHarvester.jpg?itok=jQssOzKk" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/0413SNOWWaterHarvester.jpg?itok=jQssOzKk 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/0413SNOWWaterHarvester.jpg?itok=G8IsPw7b 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption"></div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      V.

That sheet is placed between a solar absorber and a condenser plate and positioned inside a chamber. At night the chamber is opened, allowing ambient air to diffuse through the porous MOF and water molecules to stick to its interior surfaces, gathering in groups of eight to form tiny cubic droplets. In the morning, the chamber is closed, and sunlight entering through a window on top of the device then heats up the MOF, which liberates the water droplets and drives them&#8212;as vapor&#8212;toward the cooler condenser. The temperature difference, as well as the high humidity inside the chamber, causes the vapor to condense as liquid water, which drips into a collector. The setup works so well that&#160;<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aam8743">it pulls 2.8 liters of water out of the air per day</a>&#160;for every kilogram of MOF it contained, the Berkeley and MIT team reports today in&#160;<cite>Science</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It has been a longstanding dream&#8221; to harvest water from desert air, says Mercouri Kanatzidis, a chemist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who wasn&#8217;t involved with the work. &#8220;This demonstration &#8230; is a significant proof of concept.&#8221; It&#8217;s also one that Yaghi says has plenty of room for improvement. For starters, zirconium costs $150 a kilogram, making water-harvesting devices too expensive to be broadly useful. However, Yaghi says his group has already had early success in designing water-grabbing MOFs that replace zirconium with aluminum, a metal that is 100 times cheaper. That could make future water harvesters cheap enough not only to slake the thirst of people in arid regions, but perhaps even supply water to farmers in the desert.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>*Update, 14 March, 12:28 p.m.:</strong>&#160;This item has been updated to reflect the fact that the device pulls nearly 3 liters of water out of the air for every kilogram of the water-absorbing material that is used.</em></p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="This new solar-powered device can pull water straight from the desert air" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

It&#8217;s time to place your bets, for NASA&#8217;s Cassini spacecraft, which has spent the past 13 years exploring the planet and its moons, is finally swooping close enough to take a look.</p>\n\n<p>On 26 April, it will thread the gap between the gas giant and its rings in the first of 22 week-long orbits that will culminate in September with a fiery and fatal plunge into the atmosphere. The Grand Finale, as NASA is calling the forays, should help answer questions about Saturn&#8217;s atmosphere and interior. But most of all, it should end a debate about the mass of the water ice rings, which is a big clue to their age&#8212;whether they are 4.5 billion years old, nearly as old as the planet, or much younger. The Cassini team has a betting pool on the mass: $5 a wager, due before the first orbit.</p>\n\n<p>The route will be dangerous. The gap contains ice particles finer than soot, which ought not to harm the spacecraft. But if the models are wrong, and Cassini collides at 122,000 kilometers per hour with something even as large as a BB, the mission will end early. &#8220;This is something we wouldn&#8217;t want to try at another time,&#8221; says Earl Maize, the Cassini program manager at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) in Pasadena, California. To be cautious, on its first pass, Cassini will hide behind its large antenna, using it as a shield to protect its instruments.</p>\n\n<p>As the spacecraft plunges toward the rings in subsequent orbits, a radio telescope in Argentina will be listening for tiny Doppler shifts in Cassini&#8217;s signal. Those will allow the team to tease out the gravitational pull of the rings from that of Saturn&#8212;a distinction that could not be made when Cassini was orbiting outside the rings, says Luciano Iess, a planetary scientist at the Sapienza University of Rome. The measurement could provide a verdict on the rings&#8217; mass&#8212;and their age.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, many scientists have assumed that the rings are nearly as old as Saturn itself&#8212;massive structures formed of icy planetary building blocks. Early on, Cassini showed the B ring, one of four main rings, to be bright and nearly opaque, bolstering the view that the ice particles are dense and that the rings have a total mass greater than Saturn&#8217;s 400-kilometer-wide moon, Mimas.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="figure__minimal entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-related-articles align-right"><article class="media media--var media--priority-2"><div class="media__icon">\n        \n  \n      <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/food-microbes-abundant-enceladus"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.sciencemag.org//www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/grid_thumb_-_290x163__16_9_/public/4852_PIA11688_1280x720.jpg?itok=lNtM6FkI" alt="An image of Enceladus plumes"></a>  \n      </div>\n    \n    <div class="media__body">\n              <h3 class="overline"></h3>\n      \n\n      \n      <h2 class="media__headline">\n        <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/food-microbes-abundant-enceladus">Food for microbes abundant on Enceladus</a>\n      </h2>\n          </div>\n  </article></figure><p>But an alternate view is gaining credence: that the rings are more delicate structures formed within the last 100 million years from the smashed ice of a lost moon. An age of 4.5 billion years is hard to reconcile with their pristine color, because a steady stream of sooty micrometeoroids from interplanetary space should have darkened them by now, like drops of black ink spreading in a pool of white paint. Moreover, the spacing between rippling, spiral waves within the rings, created by gravitational resonances with Saturn&#8217;s moons, can offer another clue to mass, and judging from a handful of wavelets recently spied within the bright B ring, it is low. Iess believes the total mass of the rings to be just 20% to 80% of Mimas.</p>\n\n<p>Cassini may reveal another clue when its close passage gives it the best view yet of the interior C and D rings. Amid the C ring&#8217;s icy particles, there are hints of larger chunks of rubble, says Jeff Cuzzi, a ring specialist at NASA&#8217;s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, who believes the rings are young. &#8220;This could even be the core of the object that formed the rings.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>By catching stray ring particles, the spacecraft could also learn more about the makeup of the rings themselves, which are at least 90% water ice. Their distinctive shade of taupe could come from reddish iron oxide or carotene, the orange of carrots.</p>\n\n<p>As the spacecraft&#8217;s orbits take it ever closer to Saturn itself, it will shift its attention from the rings to the planet&#8217;s roiling ammonia clouds. Its cameras should see the structure of storms, and shadows could reveal the architecture of sharp lines of clouds that may extend for several thousand kilometers. Close-up measurements of the planet&#8217;s magnetic field could finally reveal the length of a day on Saturn. With no solid surface to define a day, scientists hope to use periodic patterns in Saturn&#8217;s magnetic field to get at the rotation of its interior.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in the last five orbits, &#8220;we&#8217;re going to dip our toe into the atmosphere of Saturn,&#8221; says Linda Spilker, the Cassini project scientist at JPL. It will be the first time humanity has sampled the atmosphere of a gas giant since the Galileo spacecraft dropped a probe into Jupiter in 1995. If they get lucky, researchers could estimate the abundances of helium and hydrogen in Saturn&#8217;s outer layers, which, in turn, could help illuminate its interior structure and how gas giants form.</p>\n\n<p>On its final dive into Saturn, on 15 September, Cassini will point its antenna to Earth, but the spacecraft should go silent quickly, vaporizing within 3 minutes. Planners deemed it necessary to destroy Cassini rather than leave it wandering near Saturn because it may carry stowaway terrestrial microbes that could contaminate two Saturn moons, Titan and Enceladus, that have potentially habitable conditions.</p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s much to do before then. Cuzzi, though he favors youthful, low-mass rings, hasn&#8217;t gotten his bet into the pool yet. He&#8217;s waiting until the last minute. &#8220;I know time is getting short.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="In mission\'s last hurrah, Cassini aims to solve riddle of Saturn\'s rings" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Aboriginal woman, of the Dunghutti and Bundjalung peoples. I heard about the March for Science through Twitter and then one of the organizers invited me to join the Australian organizing committee. I see it as an opportunity to bridge the science and Aboriginal Australian communities.</p>\n              <p>Aboriginal Australian cultures are rich in science, having developed over 65,000 years a knowledge of natural, ecological sustainability that was applied to our own lands. These methodologies are now important for bushlands that need vegetation and renewal, and they could be applied to Australian national parks and marine areas.</p>\n              <p>The march is important at several levels: I&#8217;m from a small town and there is a big movement back home to promote natural and sustainable farming in response to the trend toward big-business agriculture. The local river runs into the ocean, carrying run-off pollution that has caused algal blooms. At the national level, there is the Great Barrier Reef, where shipping and overfishing are killing the ocean and Australian marine biodiversity. Internationally, there is a domino effect in which the policies of the United States will influence policies here. For example, coal mining is also big in Australia, and those promoting mining are not looking into the environmental impact it will have over the next 50 years.</p>\n              <p>We need to be more inclusive in science. We should promote awareness of Aboriginal Australians&#8217; views and encourage all Aboriginal peoples interested in a science career to study and go for it. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/dennis-normile">Dennis Normile</a></i></p>\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Australia_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header black">Australia</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/18_cc_AUSTRALIA---Stuart-Khan-1_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Stuart Kahn</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p class="black">We&#8217;re up to about 10 marches</p>\n                    <footer class="black">Stuart Khan, 45, environmental engineer specializing in chemical contaminants in water at University of New South Wales in Sydney </footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I first heard of the March for Science through social media. We noticed a couple of march sites that started up in the United States. The response in Australia has not been as substantial as in the U.S., but I think it has been positive and relatively strong. We&#8217;re a bit disappointed that the big science associations are not participating. But we are up to about 10 marches. As for participation, we&#8217;ll find out on 22 April. If it doesn&#8217;t rain, we might have a few thousand in each city.</p>\n              <p>I have long been concerned about the alarmingly low level of appreciation for science exhibited by politicians in Australia as well as in other countries. I firmly believe that an improved appreciation for science holds the key to all of the great challenges we currently face. It&#8217;s not just climate change; the antivaccination and anti&#8211;water fluoridation movements are fairly big here. There is a general lack of trust in and respect for what science can tell us; people don&#8217;t know how much faith to put into science. If the science doesn&#8217;t suit their preconceived beliefs, people feel open to alternatives.</p>\n              <p>Science is very global. I collaborate with people in other countries every day, use data developed by other research groups, and make knowledge and information available to others. If science suffers in one country, the whole system suffers. Especially if that country has been contributing as much as the U.S. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/dennis-normile">Dennis Normile</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Austria">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Austria_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header black">Austria</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/19_cc_AUSTRIA---Renee-Schroeder_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Stefan Knittel</p>\n                <div class="card-text austria">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote black">\n                    <p class="black">Science has always had open borders</p>\n                    <footer class="black">Ren&#233;e Schroeder, 63, biochemist at the Max Perutz Laboratories in Vienna</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>On 22 April I would normally have been at a retreat with about 100 other scientists of our research project on RNA biology. But I was contacted by Oliver Lehman, the organizer of the march here in Vienna, and we have decided to skip lunch and cut the retreat short so that we can all take part in the March for Science.</p>\n              <p>It&#8217;s important to advocate for science. Antienlightenment sentiments are rising worldwide. Many Austrians are against genetic engineering but don&#8217;t know what a gene is, for instance. I have a problem with that. It&#8217;s almost fashionable to be against science nowadays.</p>\n              <p>But this march is part of a global movement that has really gained momentum after Trump&#8217;s inauguration. We had a similar situation here in Austria last year. There was a lot of fear that the populist Norbert Hofer would win the presidential elections, but a movement for enlightenment and tolerance, full of optimism, sprang up. This march feels like a continuation of that, and like science itself, it is international. Science has always had open borders, more so than nation states.</p>\n              <p>I think the march will be fairly big. We&#8217;re still discussing what signs we want to make. There will be tables set out along the route where people can do experiments and scientists can engage with the public. Saturday afternoon is a good time because there will be lots of people in the city. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/kai-kupferschmidt">Kai Kupferschmidt</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Germany">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Germany_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header black">Germany</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/11_cc_GERMANY---Martin-Stratmann_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Axel Griesch</p>\n                <div class="card-text germany">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p class="black">This is not a march against Trump</p>\n                    <footer class="black">Martin Stratmann, 62, electrochemist and president of Max Planck Society in Munich </footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>The last and only time I went to a protest was as a pupil. This was around 1968, and we were marching to change the school system, which was too hierarchical. This time I am marching for two reasons: One is that the employees at the Max Planck Society, the Ph.D. students, the directors, will be happy to see their president showing his support for the movement. And I have a strong personal motivation: Today, science is more important than ever before, but evidence and knowledge are being questioned in many places, including politics. Like many people, I have been following the political developments in the last 18 months with great concern. </p>\n              <p>This is a march pro-science and pro-facts, not a march against Trump. Of course, in the U.S., Trump has come to symbolize how little facts and evidence are currently being valued in politics, and that scientific freedom is restricted in part because results are politically inconvenient. But we face the same concerns in Europe; for example, a leading university is under threat in Hungary. In addition, the Max Planck Society has employees from all over the world&#8212;including from Iran, China, and Turkey. Many of these researchers know how science is restricted in their countries of origin. And that is often connected with restrictions of freedom in general. They want to say clearly that science should be free everywhere, that people should be free everywhere.</p>\n              <p>I expect the march in Munich to be very diverse. It&#8217;s a cosmopolitan city that has the highest density of science in Germany. I think that younger people especially will take the opportunity to march for their future. They will face the consequences of our global problems in their lifetimes. We have to spell out to society that we cannot solve these problems without science. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/kai-kupferschmidt">Kai Kupferschmidt</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Greenland">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Greenland_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Greenland</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/3_cc_GREENLAND----Michael-MacFerrin_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Horst Machguth</p>\n                <div class="card-text greenland">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>It will be a powerful image from this remote corner that people care</p>\n                    <footer>Mike MacFerrin, 37, graduate student in glaciology at the University of Colorado in Boulder </footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I decided early on that I would really like to go to the March for Science. I figured I could use some airline miles to get to D.C. Because I&#8217;m a field glaciologist, I was going to bring my parka, Baffin boots, and ski goggles. When the date was announced, I realized I was going to be in Greenland. Then about 3 minutes later, I realized there wasn&#8217;t any reason we couldn&#8217;t do it there. </p>\n              <p>Several other teams will be there, many from Europe, staging in Kangerlussuaq, a town of maybe 600 people. It has the main airport in Greenland; roughly half the town is employed by the airport. I got in touch with Nini Frydkj&#230;r Holstebro, a Greenlander and a friend, to make sure that local officials were OK with it. She&#8217;s a small business owner and a pillar of the community. </p>\n              <p>Due to the recent political turmoil here in the United States, I&#8217;ve become more active politically in the last year than I ever was in my life. Science in our country&#8212;and we&#8217;re not the only place&#8212;is coming under attack. Scientists are being portrayed as nefarious people. I work on a project funded by NASA&#8217;s Cryospheric Sciences Program, part of NASA&#8217;s earth science division. Trump recently proposed cuts to the division&#8212;at a really crucial time.</p>\n              <p> The changes we&#8217;re seeing in Greenland are dramatic. People in Kangerlussuaq have a reason to care. A bridge partly washed out in 2012, due to runoff from the ice sheet. I liken the attacks on science to turning off the headlights. We&#8217;re driving fast and people don&#8217;t want to see what&#8217;s coming up. Scientists&#8212;we&#8217;re the headlights. </p>\n              <p>I&#8217;ve spent a couple hundred dollars of my own money on a 12-foot banner. It says &#8220;March for Science, Greenland. Science not Silence.&#8221; I plan to put up signs around town. We&#8217;ll invite anyone who wants to come. We&#8217;ll walk from the port station to the bridge. It will be like three blocks. Then we&#8217;ll drive out to the ice sheet and get some photos. Our march is just one of many, but it will be a powerful image from this remote corner that people care. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/erik-stokstad">Erik Stokstad</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Iceland">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Iceland_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Iceland</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/9_ICELAND%20Erna_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Kristinn Ingvarsson, University of Iceland</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>This is one of the biggest things we&#8217;ve done for science in Iceland</p>\n                    <footer>Erna Magn&#250;sd&#243;ttir, 43, molecular biologist at the University of Iceland in Reykjavik and president of the Iceland Academy of Sciences</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>This is one of the biggest things we&#8217;ve done for science in Iceland. We&#8217;re going to march from a hill called Sk&#243;lav&#246;r&#240;uholt where there is a statue of Leif Erikson. That&#8217;s a bit symbolic. He discovered America, and now America is in trouble. We&#8217;re walking half a kilometer down to the center of the city. We&#8217;ll have a seminar with three speakers, talking about public policy and funding issues in Iceland. An American sociologist will tell us about the atmosphere in America.</p>\n              <p>We got the idea for the march just after the Trump administration took over. We saw a disregard for science. People got very scared for the future of the planet. First of all, it&#8217;s the issue of what the Trump administration will do about global warming.</p>\n              <p>It&#8217;s also the idea of informed policy, of evidence-based policies. We have to fight for that here in Iceland, like everywhere. Politicians use evidence when it fits their views. We feel like we&#8217;re shunned when it does not suit them. And we&#8217;re really struggling and fighting for proper funding of science. They&#8217;re cutting some of the competitive funds. We need 60% more funding to reach the average of [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] countries. This is not a very ambitious goal for a rich country.</p>\n              <p>The person leading the march, &#198;var &#222;or Benediktsson, is a bit of a TV celebrity here. He hosts a show for children about science and he also has a radio program. He&#8217;s a very positive, fun guy. One of the goals is to get people involved, to get them to think about science. Everyone should feel like they are part of science. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/erik-stokstad">Erik Stokstad</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Italy">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Italy_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Italy</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/8_cc_ValenteRdJ_16x9_0.jpg"><p class="credit">Courtesy Marco Valente</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>We feel there is a lack of respect towards academia</p>\n                    <footer>Marco Valente, 53, teaches Economics at the University of L&#8217;Aquila</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I am a member of a network of university researchers that promotes better policies for public universities and fights research cuts. When we learned about the March for Science in the United States, we thought we had good reasons to join them. Science is being challenged in Italy as well; scientific evidence is questioned, and it is often distorted for political needs. The way the Xylella fastidiosa outbreak in olive trees in southern Italy was handled; the vaccine debate, with the dramatic drop of vaccination rates; or the infamous Stamina case, where an unproven therapy was tested on humans due to media pressure, are good examples. Newspapers and political parties often depict science, research, and professors in negative terms. We feel there is a lack of respect towards academia. Many people don&#8217;t know how much authority to attribute to various sources of information.</p>\n              <p>We will participate in the march without any affiliation to specific groups and without a specific platform of demands. We just want to engage public opinion on the risk of losing scientific objectivity. Many people are letting us know they will support us, and we are beginning to receive the support of [nongovernmental organizations], universities, and research centers. </p>\n              <p>What do we expect? That people understand the difference between a scientific debate and a debate about the future of society. As an academic, I would also expect politicians to trust us more. For at least 10 years, politicians have only produced repressive policies for universities. They don&#8217;t see academia as a promoter of knowledge but as a teaching institution. Finally, we&#8217;d like to see more attention towards global warming, with effective policies and more pressure on the U.S. to force them to change their position. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/luca-tancredi-barone">Luca Tancredi Barone</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Japan">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Japan_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Japan</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/10_cc_JAPAN---Rintaro-Mori_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Courtesy Rintaro Mori </p>\n                <div class="card-text japan">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>Science provides an objective view that is important for decision-making</p>\n                    <footer>Rintaro Mori, 46, medical doctor and public health epidemiologist at the National Center for Child Health and Development in Tokyo and director of Cochrane Japan</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>This is the first time I have been involved in such an activity. I have a huge concern and also have professional and academic interests in the sustainability of our global society. I believe the scientific community has a very important role to address issues honestly, even challenging taboos, to provide objective information so as to achieve sustainable development. We&#8217;re not advocating for funding. Rather, science provides an objective view that is important for decision-making. Too many decisions are biased by vested interests, and this is leading our society in a wrong way. I think the march is a very good opportunity to help the general public recognize this important role of the scientific community.</p>\n              <p>One interesting phenomenon in this context is the use of the human papillomavirus vaccine. This is standard in many countries but Japan is well behind because of a series of events that created adverse publicity. The government has not been able to make a decision. The scientific community can help. </p>\n              <p>Cochrane is one of the organizations supporting the March for Science. I don&#8217;t think the march is very prominent in the Japanese community yet. I am discussing how we are going to participate with my colleagues. We are still waiting for approval from the police department. (There was a delay in applying for march permits.) There should be no problem. But without that we cannot circulate information about what we are doing.

Another group was already organizing a march for science down Reforma Avenue, but I have had no luck getting in touch with them. So the academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine got together and decided to organize a parallel rally outside of the Palacio de Miner&#237;a, a landmark colonial building downtown that used to be an engineering school.</p>\n              <p>At first the main motivation was Donald Trump&#8217;s policies, especially about immigration. Limitations on visas could affect thousands of Mexican students and researchers, even those who simply want to attend a scientific meeting in the U.S. Maintaining international collaborations and openness benefits everyone. The fact that the U.S. has been able to attract the best students from around the world has been a source of strength and richness for the country. Mexico has more students in the U.S. than in any other country, and we also have many engineers working at NASA, for example.</p>\n              <p>But as the organizing has gone on, we&#8217;ve realized we don&#8217;t want to focus too much on Trump. We want to send a larger message about how important science is for Mexico&#8217;s economic development and how it can create change in our country</p>\n              <p>There isn&#8217;t a long history of activism for science in Mexico. Political protests happen all the time in Mexico City, and they don&#8217;t seem to change anything. Many people here don&#8217;t see the point of marching for anything anymore. Our challenge is to overcome people&#8217;s apathy and convince them to participate in this one, which we hope will be part of a global movement. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/lizzie-wade">Lizzie Wade</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Netherlands">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Netherlands_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Netherlands</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/12_cc_NETHERLANDS---Karen-Maex-%282%29_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">UvA</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>I&#8217;m in.

Absolutely. Academic freedom is one of the most important issues to me, and recent developments in Europe have threatened it. The Hungarian government has signed a decree that targets and silences Central European University. I don&#8217;t need to tell you that many academics in Turkey have been arrested and detained. I find that very worrisome. I&#8217;m concerned about the United States as well. Climate science is often sidelined without proper arguments and people promote &#8216;alternative facts&#8217; that have no basis in academic research. Of course there are issues in the Netherlands as well, but they&#8217;re a different order of magnitude.</p>\n              <p>I&#8217;m not the type of rector to start recruiting people for the march. This is not something that should come from the board; people can make up their own minds. But I know the issue is very widely discussed, and I think there will be a big delegation from our university, both students and staff. I know that rectors of several other universities are joining as well. This is something that the academic community in the Netherlands feels strongly about and we hope to send a clear message. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/martin-enserink">Martin Enserink</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="NewZealand">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/NewZealand_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">New Zealand</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/1_cc_NEW-ZELAND---Craig-Stevens_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Aitana Forc&#233;n-V&#225;zquez</p>\n                <div class="card-text newzealand">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>Trump was the thing that initiated it</p>\n                    <footer>Craig Stevens, physical oceanographer at the University of Auckland, president of the New Zealand Association of Scientists</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>Because of the time difference, we were the first place in the world to march for women and we can be the first to march for scientists. We expect to have three or four marches around the country. Mind you, we are a country of just 3 to 4 million, with 11,000 scientists and an equal number of research students. And the march is not just for scientists; anyone who values science can participate. I&#8217;m going to be a speaker. I&#8217;m tentatively scheduled to talk at the Wellington march, but it&#8217;s not coming together as strongly as the one in Auckland, so I might go up to there.</p>\n              <p>Trump was the thing that initiated it; we even put out a press release about his election. We have issues here but if it were not for the new U.S. administration, they would not have been enough to get us into the streets. As president of the society, we advocate for science and reject pseudoscience. We try to inject science into policy. We are a small player, so we depend on results from the rest of the world. There&#8217;s a big concern that if there&#8217;s an overall downturn in science, it will embolden people locally and internationally to cease to value the view of science.</p>\n              <p>For New Zealand, this march comes at a good time. This is an election year and the march puts science more firmly in the political picture. It will raise the appreciation of science. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/elizabeth-pennisi">Elizabeth Pennisi</a></i></p>\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/NewZealand_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">New Zealand</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/13_NEW%20ZEALAND%20Nicola%20Gaston_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Colin MacDiarmid</p>\n                <div class="card-text newzealand2">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>I feel everyone should know about it</p>\n                    <footer>Nicola Gaston, physicist at the University of Auckland; helped organize the March for Science in New Zealand, but will be in the United States on 22 April and hopes to march in Washington, D.C.</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I am planning to march because I believe in society. We need to stand up for things we believe in, whether that is science, knowledge, or the value of evidence-based policy and informed democratic discourse. I feel like everyone should know about it, but the reality is that many New Zealanders have more important things to worry about than the status of science!</p>\n              <p>Because science careers are often international, we need to stand in solidarity with our colleagues in the U.S. who are affected by the politicization of science and loss of funding. But even more than that, I am concerned with the dismissal of scientific and other forms of knowledge as the basis for rational conversation, and ultimately agreement within society. In New Zealand, former Prime Minister <a href="http://www.noted.co.nz/archive/listener-nz-2011/john-keys-unhappy-week-at-the-bbc/" target="_blank">John Key famously said about scientist Mike Joy</a>, who has raised concern about the impact of the dairy industry on freshwater quality, &#8216;He&#8217;s one academic, and like lawyers, I can provide you with another one that will give you a counter view.&#8217;</p>\n              <p>After the march is over, I think we are going to see a lot more soul searching within the scientific community about the purpose of a march, whether it has achieved anything, and whether more collective action, perhaps internationally, is necessary in order to make progress on the issues that have been raised. One of the big issues is the issue of diversity in the scientific community, which is being widely discussed using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/marginsci?lang=en" target="_blank">#marginsci</a>. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/elizabeth-pennisi">Elizabeth Pennisi</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Norway">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Norway_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Norway</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/15_cc_NORWAY---Annette-Bayer_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Stefan Amlie/UiT </p>\n                <div class="card-text norway">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>This may be the most northern March for Science</p>\n                    <footer>Annette Bayer, 45, chemist at the Arctic University of Norway in Troms&#248;</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I think this may be the most northern March for Science. It will start at one of the research institutes and go through the city center. In April, the weather in Troms&#248; can be everything from snow, to rain, to sun. I have a feeling that people are determined to attend. The Norwegians in general are not very sensitive to weather. We say, &#8216;There&#8217;s never bad weather, only bad clothing.&#8217;</p>\n              <p>My first reaction was that I wanted to participate to support my colleagues in the U.S. When I thought more about it, I realized it&#8217;s not just in the U.S.; supporting and recognizing the importance of knowledge is a global issue. There are issues in Norway related to resources, particularly oil and fisheries. If you want to use resources sustainably, it&#8217;s important to base your decision on knowledge.</p>\n              <p>It will be the first demonstration I have ever participated in. I think it&#8217;s really important that people understand that most scientists work for the benefit of all of us. At the moment, my colleagues and I are doing research in the field of using [carbon dioxide] as a carbon source to make drugs, fuels, and plastics, instead of using oil. The other topic we work on is antibiotic resistance. It&#8217;s a good example of how ignoring knowledge can have important consequences for global health.</p>\n              <p>There are marches all over the world. It would be very nice if that would encourage politicians as well as industrial leaders to really make decisions based on facts and not belief. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/erik-stokstad">Erik Stokstad</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Poland">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Poland_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Poland</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/17_POLAND---Justyna-Wojniak_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Justyna Wojniak</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>We are planning a day filled with small events</p>\n                    <footer>Justyna Wojniak, 38, educational policy researcher at the Pedagogical University of Krak&#243;w and spokesperson for the Polish Women Scientists Network</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>This is the first march the network participates in. The Polish march has not been organized as an action against Donald Trump, although his international policy certainly worries us. In Poland, we are facing many other issues of concern. The right-wing government and conservative majority in the Parliament have introduced several changes to the legal system and new regulations for public institutions that many Polish people perceive as a serious threat to democracy.</p>\n              <p>In the field of science, the government recently announced serious changes to the university system without widely consulting the scientific community. The main goal, it seems, is to make the university an entrepreneurial institution driven by market rules, competition, flexible employment, and cooperation with industry. There is now pressure and censorship on researchers in the social sciences and humanities to favor conservative and religious ideology. Polish science has other problems as well. It lacks a transparent granting system, a simple academic career path, and clear rules for promotion.</p>\n              <p>We are planning a day filled with small events at different locations in Warsaw, including a lecture on the role of science in politics and society, workshops, and scientific caf&#233;s. We hope that the informal atmosphere will enable the public to feel that they are touching science and that science really matters in their everyday lives. We would also like to be heard and treated seriously by the minister of science and higher education. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/elisabeth-pain">Elizabeth Pain</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Portugal">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Portugal_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Portugal</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/4_PORTUGAL---Carlos-Moedas_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">European Union, 2017/Nicolas Kovarik</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>Science is not a dispensable luxury</p>\n                    <footer>Carlos Moedas, European commissioner for research, science and innovation in Brussels.</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I&#8217;m really proud that the call for the March for Science resonated in so many countries and that a march is organized in my home country, Portugal.

We need science for the advancement of our societies and to inform our education, improve our policies, and spur innovation. Science, as a common good, also helps all of us to make sense of and navigate the more and more complex world we live in. So when special interests threaten scientific evidence and long-term research and when access to and diffusion of science is hampered, we have to stand up in support of the scientific community.</p>\n              <p>As the EU commissioner for research, science and innovation, I&#8217;m very proud to stand up for science and join the march in Lisbon. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/elisabeth-pain">Elizabeth Pain</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Spain">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Spain_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header black">Spain</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/14_ccEP_SPAIN---Nazario-Marti%CC%81n-Leo%CC%81n_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Courtesy of Nazario Mart&#237;n</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p class="black">The global and local issues go hand in hand</p>\n                    <footer class="black">Nazario Mart&#237;n, organic chemist at the Complutense University of Madrid and president of the Confederation of Scientific Societies of Spain (COSCE)</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I have marched for science in the past, but this march is pretty unique because it originated in the United States in response to the denial of demonstrated scientific facts like evolution and global warming by Trump and his cabinet. This is no joke: It represents a threat for science and could affect the health and the future of our planet. Countries in Europe are reacting to this tsunami from the United States by defending science not only globally but also within their own national context. The global and local issues go hand in hand.</p>\n              <p>In Spain, the situation is worrying because our political leadership shows no interest in empowering science. The government budget for 2017 represents a 2.6% decrease for research projects and institutions. The National Research Agency that the scientific community had been demanding for years is now starting operations, but it lacks the multiyear funding and scientific independence that were originally promised. All in all, we demand more financial support for research but also a better representation of science in politics.</p>\n              <p>There isn&#8217;t much of a tradition of marches and protests among Spanish scientists, so at COSCE we launched a manifesto for science, in the hope to make up for a possible lack of physical support in Madrid on 22 April. We will be meeting representatives of the Spanish Parliament on 26 April and it would be great if we could gather the signatures of several thousands of scientists. I am also hoping that the public realizes the importance of science for social progress and welfare, and will join the march and the manifesto. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/elisabeth-pain">Elizabeth Pain</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="SouthKorea">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/SouthKorea_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header black">South Korea</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/2_cc_SOUTH-KOREA---Eun-Kyoung-Jee_16x9.jpg?itok=shWCKHOp"><p class="credit">Courtesy Eun-Kyoung Jee</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p class="black">We will highlight the need for more women scientists and engineers</p>\n                    <footer class="black">Eun-Kyoung Jee, first-year graduate student in chemistry at Pohang University of Science and Technology </footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I have an interest in communication between scientists and the public. I have loved science for a long time and when I talk to people about science I realize it is separate from their lives, especially in Korea. We have people who reject using chemical products such as bleach, detergent, and toothpaste. We say they have &#8216;chemophobia.&#8217; It&#8217;s similar to the antivaccine feelings in the United States. I have a concern about this because my major is chemistry. I am also really concerned that the divide between science and the public will become more vast under Trump&#8217;s administration. This will be felt in the U.S. at first but the effect will spread worldwide because of the power of the United States.</p>\n              <p>I heard about the march at a meeting of Femicircuit, a union of women science and engineering students, faculty, and graduates affiliated with top Korean universities. The environment is not favorable for women. There are numerous inequalities and inconveniences. There are even fewer toilets for women in science and engineering buildings. Our goals are to talk about this and make an environment that is equal. Maybe 16 or 17 members of Femicircuit will participate, and we&#8217;ll have an information booth to highlight the need for more women scientists and engineers. The March for Science is occurring all over the world, and we are trying to make participants here feel they are part of a global effort. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/dennis-normile">Dennis Normile</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Uganda">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Uganda_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Uganda</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/7_cc_UGANDA---Clet-Wandui-Masiga_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Tropical Institute of Development Innovations</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>Everyone is upbeat and excited about the event</p>\n                    <footer>Clet Wandui Masiga, 41, plant and livestock geneticist at the Tropical Institute of Development Innovations in Entebbe</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I evaluate biotechnology that might be developed in Uganda, mostly plant varieties.

We are going to carry placards with information on how science has been useful, and some of the tools that we no longer think we need to use, like the hand hoe. We have other technology like genetically engineered crops that are resistant to herbicides. We don&#8217;t want this hoe. It is breaking our backs. We will carry all the old models of phones. We will carry herbal medicine.</p>\n              <p>When we get to the Parliament, one of us will read a petition. We have requested that the speaker of the Parliament talk to us about the government&#8217;s position on science and technology. They should pass the National Biotechnology and Biosafety Bill. That will allow the government to regulate genetically engineered crops in a manner that is safe. </p>\n              <p>We are going to have farmers, professionals, civil servants, and politicians in the march. When we contacted the police for clearance, they said police officers can also participate, because it is nonpolitical. The police have a brass band. A band is very good at mobilizing people. Everyone is upbeat and excited about the event.

I think that we are entering unchartered waters in this era of &#8216;Brex-ump&#8217; and, more than ever, the world needs science; after all, through technology, it is the dominant force on modern culture. (And yes, all you snobs out there, culture is as much about science as it is about the performing arts!)</p>\n            <p>I am alarmed by the rise of rhetoric that mocks experts, uneasy about whether the lifeblood of science&#8212;the global movement of people and ideas&#8212;will pump so freely in the era of Brex-ump and dismayed by &#8216;policy-based evidencemaking,&#8217; which includes moves to curtail research that challenges government dogma with inconvenient truths. And, yes, I do think this is indeed a global issue. In a nutshell, though I cannot make it for personal reasons, I think the march is a jolly good thing. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/daniel-clery">Daniel Clery</a></i></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>  \n</div>\n<span property="dc:title" content="Marchers around the world tell us why they\'re taking to the streets for science" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Physicists propose test of controversial idea</h1>  <p class="byline byline--article">\n  By <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/author/adrian-cho">Adrian Cho</a><time>Apr. 14, 2017 , 3:00 AM</time></p>\n</header><p>More than 40 years ago, a leading relativity theorist made a surprising prediction. Whereas empty space should feel immeasurably cold to any observer gliding along at a constant speed, one who is accelerating, say because he\'s riding a rocket, would find empty space hot. This so-called Unruh effect seemed practically impossible to measure, but now four theorists claim they have devised a doable experiment that could confirm the underlying physics. Skeptics say it will do no such thing&#8212;but for contradictory reasons.</p>\n\n<p>"The hope is that this will convince skeptics that the whole thing is coherent," says Stephen Fulling, a theoretical physicist and mathematician at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station who was not involved in the work. But Vladimir Belinski, a theorist at International Network of Centers for Relativistic Astrophysics in Pescara, Italy, says, "The Unruh effect is nonsense, it\'s based on a mathematical mistake."</p>\n\n<p>According to Albert Einstein\'s theories of special and general relativity, things can appear bizarrely different to observers in motion relative to one another. Suppose you stand next to a meter stick with a watch on your wrist. If your friend zips past at near&#8211;light-speed, she\'ll see that the stick is shorter than a meter and that your watch ticks abnormally slowly. Conversely, if she carries a meter stick, you\'ll see it contract and, to you, <em>her</em> watch will tick slowly.</p>\n\n<p>Things get even weirder if one observer accelerates. Any observer traveling at a constant speed will measure the temperature of empty space as absolute zero. But an accelerated observer will find the vacuum hotter. At least that\'s what William Unruh, a theorist at the University British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, argued in 1976. To a nonaccelerating observer, the vacuum is devoid of particles&#8212;so that if he holds a particle detector it will register no clicks. In contrast, Unruh argued, an accelerated observer will detect a fog of photons and other particles, as the number of quantum particles flitting about depends on an observer\'s motion. The greater the acceleration, the higher the temperature of that fog or "bath."</p>\n\n<p>The effect is too feeble to measure directly. To see the vacuum heat to 1 K, an observer would have to accelerate 100 quadrillion times faster than the best rocket can. But Daniel Vanzella, a theorist at the University of S&#227;o Paulo in S&#227;o Carlos, Brazil, and colleagues argue that it should be possible to detect the key thing&#8212;the fog of photons seen by the accelerating observer&#8212;by studying light radiated by electrons.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how that would work: Suppose you shoot a bunch of electrons laterally across a magnetic field. Basic physics dictates that the electrons will turn circles in the field. Now, apply a vertical electric field to also give the electrons an upward push. As well as circulating, the bunch of will also accelerate upward. The setup thus defines two frames of reference. In the frame accelerating upward with the bunch, the electrons turn circles (see figure). In the nonaccelerating "lab frame" the bunch traces a stretched corkscrew trajectory.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="graphic entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-figure"><h3 class="graphic__header">Testing the Unruh effect</h3>\n  <div class="graphic__body">\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The proposed experiment is a tale of two reference frames.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/040617SNOW_electronCorkskrew.jpg?itok=NFa5Og7r" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/040617SNOW_electronCorkskrew.jpg?itok=NFa5Og7r 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/040617SNOW_electronCorkskrew.jpg?itok=jYb7UaZl 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption"></div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      V. Altounian/<i>Science</i>, adapted from Adrian Cho  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure></figure><p>Vanzella and colleagues start their analysis in the accelerating frame, where they assume the circulating electrons encounter that fog of photons. The electrons will both absorb photons from and radiate photons into the fog. Weirdly, every event in the accelerated frame in which the electrons absorb or emit a photon corresponds to an event in the lab frame in which the electrons emit a photon. The theorists use relativity theory to&#160;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03446">predict the spectrum of emitted photons in the lab</a>&#160;frame, as they report in a paper in press at&#160;<cite>Physical Review Letters</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>In the lab frame, they calculate, the spectrum of emitted photons should have a tell-tale excess at long wavelengths&#8212;but only if there was a fog of photons in the accelerating frame to begin with, Vanzella says. Roughly speaking, the fog of photons in the accelerated frame heats up the electrons and makes them radiate a bit more in the lab frame. Thus, the experiment would provide a way to test whether the Unruh effect exists: Observe the excess of long-wavelength photons in the lab frame, and you\'ll know that the accelerated frame space is full of photons.</p>\n\n<p>Skeptics say the experiment won&#8217;t work, but they disagree on why. If the situation isproperly analyzed, there is no fog of photons in the accelerated frame, says Detlev Buchholz, a theorist at the University of G&#246;ttingen in Germany. "The Unruh gas does not exist!" he says. Nevertheless, Buchholz says, the vacuum will appear hot to an accelerated observer, but because of a kind of friction that arises through the interplay of quantum uncertainty and acceleration. So,the experiment might show the desired effect, but that wouldn\'t reveal the supposed fog of photons in the accelerating frame.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, Robert O\'Connell, a theorist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, insists that in the accelerated frame there is a fog of photons. However, he contends, it is not possible to draw energy out of that fog to produce extra radiation in the lab frame. O\'Connell cites a basic bit of physics called the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which states that a particle interacting with a heat bath will pump as much energy into the bath as it pulls out. Thus, he argues, Unruh\'s fog of photons exists, but the experiment should not produce the supposed signal anyway.</p>\n\n<p>The discord aside, George Matsas, a theorist also at S&#227;o Paulo State University and an author on the new paper says he&#8217;s looking for experimenters interested in performing the test. It could be done with particle accelerators and electromagnets currently available, Matsas says. "The parameters in the paper were chosen to be realistic," he says. Even if the experiment works as predicted, however, the debate over the Unruh effect seems likely to smolder on.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Does space heat up when you accelerate?

And for just as long, skeptics have scoffed on the grounds that sound waves coming from meteors should arrive several&#160;minutes&#160;<em>after</em> the light waves, which travel nearly a million times faster. Now, scientists have proposed a theory to explain how our eyes and ears could perceive a meteor at nearly the same time. The hypothesis might also explain how auroras produce sound, a claim made by many indigenous peoples living at high latitudes.</p>\n\n<p>Meteors&#160;release huge amounts of energy as they disintegrate in the atmosphere. They also produce low frequency radio waves that travel at the speed of light. Some scientists have suggested that those radio waves produce the sound that accompanies meteors. The waves can cause everyday objects&#8212;including fences, hair, and glasses&#8212;to vibrate, which our ears pick up as sound between 20 and 20,000 Hertz. This phenomenon, called electrophonics, is a well-known principle: &#8220;The conversion from electromagnetic waves to sound waves &#8230; is exactly how your radio works,&#8221; says Colin Price, an atmospheric scientist at Tel Aviv University in Israel and co-author of the new study. &#8220;But in this case nature provides the conversion between electromagnetic waves and acoustic waves.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>But nailing down that scenario isn&#8217;t easy. Reports of noisy meteors are relatively scarce&#8212;there were only 40 last year, according to the American Meteor Society (AMS). And because most of these &#8220;hearings&#8221; have been made by amateur sky watchers, it&#8217;s difficult to find audio recordings to back them up. &#8220;[We&#8217;ve] never had [a recording] cross our path,&#8221; says David Meisel in Geneseo, New York, executive director of AMS. Moreover, a key question remains to be answered: How do the meteors produce low-frequency radio waves in the first place?</p>\n\n<p>Now, Price and Michael Kelley, a physicist at Cornell University, have developed a model to answer that question. As a&#160;meteor&#160;streaks through Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, it ionizes the air around it, splitting it into heavy, positively charged ions and lighter, negatively charged electrons. The ions follow the meteor, whereas the electrons are deflected by Earth&#8217;s magnetic field. That separation of positive and negative charges in the meteor&#8217;s wake produces a large electric field that drives an electrical current. And <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL072911/full">it&#8217;s that current that launches the radio waves</a>, Price and Kelley hypothesize in an upcoming issue of <cite>Geophysical Research Letters</cite>. The size of the meteor and its speed through the atmosphere would control the frequency of the radio waves, they predict.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, another research team presented a different hypothesis <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep41251">to explain how meteors make sound</a>. That team proposed that visible light from a meteor heats up materials such as hair and glasses, which then vibrate and produce sound waves. But this theory requires a &#8220;huge&#8221; light source, Price says. Only meteors as bright as the full moon could emit enough light to produce such sound waves. But according to the new theory, all meteors generate radio waves that can produce sound, some of which our ears are capable of picking up.</p>\n\n<p>Price and Kelley suggest that their model might also explain reports of &#8220;clapping&#8221; sounds accompanying auroras, the colorful light displays created when charged particles from the sun collide with molecules in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere at high latitudes. These sounds feature prominently in stories of native peoples of the northern United States, Greenland, and Canada, but they have largely been dismissed by scientists. &#8220;Auroras also create radio waves that can easily reach the ground,&#8221; Kelley says. &#160;</p>\n\n<p>The new hypothesis is &#8220;reasonable,&#8221; says Meers Oppenheim, an astronomer at Boston University not involved in the study. But it&#8217;s difficult to simulate what&#8217;s truly going on 100 kilometers up in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere as tiny particles of dust whiz by at 50 or more kilometers per second. &#8220;The devil lies in the details, and no one seems to have truly worked through those,&#8221; he says.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="New theory may explain the &#8216;music of the meteors&#8217;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Computer modeler aims to give U.S. lead in weather predictions</h1>  <p class="byline byline--article">\n  By <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/author/paul-voosen">Paul Voosen</a><time>Apr. 14, 2017 , 9:00 AM</time></p>\n</header><p>From below the conference table comes the thrum of incoming phone alerts. The new weather forecast has rolled in, and the climate scientists, even though it&#8217;s not typically their business, dig out their phones to look: snow tomorrow&#8212;hardly unusual for early February in Princeton, New Jersey. But the weather models have the storm breaking severe, dumping a foot or more. A snow day seems likely.</p>\n\n<p>Across the table at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), Shian-Jiann &#8220;S. J.&#8221; Lin is not convinced. He is the master of 20,000 lines of computer code that divide the atmosphere into boxes and, with canny accuracy, solve the equations that describe how air swirls around the globe. For decades, Lin&#8217;s program has powered the long-term simulations of many climate models, including GFDL&#8217;s&#8212;one of the crown jewels of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Now, Lin&#8217;s domain is expanding to a different side of NOAA: the short-term weather forecasts of the National Weather Service (NWS). By 2018, Lin&#8217;s program will be powering a unified system for both climate and weather forecasting, one that could predict conditions tomorrow, or a century from now&#8212;and do it faster and better than current models. His work will soon be guiding mayors planning not just for snow plows, but also rising seas.</p>\n\n<p>But Lin has started early. His small team is already running a prototype forecast on their supercomputer. And in his typically confident and brash style, he offers a minority report about the next day&#8217;s storm.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;If our forecast is correct, it&#8217;s only 3 to 6 inches,&#8221; Lin announces. His peers at the&#160;table seem skeptical. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a mess,&#8221; one warns. But Lin doesn&#8217;t budge. He rarely needs to. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see what we get tomorrow,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You want to bet?&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Much is riding on Lin. Recently, NWS has suffered some prominent embarrassments, such as in 2012, when it predicted Hurricane Sandy would sputter out over the ocean while a leading European center accurately forecast the direct hit on New York City. Fed up with the country&#8217;s second-place status, Congress in 2013 poured $48 million into NWS weather modeling. The message for NOAA was clear: Get America on top.</p>\n\n<p>This drive has opened up an opportunity. For a long time, meteorologists and climate scientists operated in separate domains. Meteorologists focused on speed: ingesting as many data as possible from satellites, balloons, and buoys and quickly spinning it into a forecast. Climate scientists focused on the fussy physics of their models to produce plausible simulations over decades. But now, the two groups are discovering common ground, in &#8220;subseasonal to seasonal&#8221; predictions&#8212;from a month to 2 years out. In order to push forecasts beyond 10 days or so, meteorologists need the superior physics of the climate models. Meanwhile, climate scientists want to know how weather phenomena that happen on monthly or annual timescales, like El Ni&#241;o, influence the global climate. &#8220;The two cultures are speaking each other&#8217;s language, and realizing they&#8217;re going to live and die together,&#8221; says John Michalakes, an atmospheric scientist at the Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, California.</p>\n\n<p>There could be another benefit to blurring the lines between weather and climate, one that climate scientists are loath to talk about explicitly. Although studies of human-driven climate change have faced scrutiny and scorn from conservative politicians in the United States, weather research remains solidly bipartisan, says David Titley, director of the Center for Solutions to Weather and Climate Risk at Pennsylvania State University in State College. Just this month, for example, Congress passed a weather forecasting bill that dedicates $26.5 million of NOAA&#8217;s budget to improving its seasonal predictions, and climate change doubters were among the supporters. &#8220;If I were running the world, I would keep that divide vague,&#8221; Titley says.</p>\n\n<p>In his modeling, Lin never made the distinction. &#8220;From the beginning we talked about how there is no difference between weather and climate,&#8221; says Ricky Rood, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Lin&#8217;s longtime collaborator. But others haven&#8217;t wanted to hear that message&#8212;and especially not from Lin, who is as feisty and fractious as a government employee can get. &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing to me,&#8221; says Rood, &#8220;that S. J. could evolve to be a source of unification.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Storms have roiled around Lin his whole life. Typhoons are regular events in Taipei, where he grew up, and he was always fascinated by their power. &#8220;I have hurricanes in my blood,&#8221; he says. Born in 1958 to parents who ran a small construction company, he was the first in his family to go to college. As a student at National Taiwan University, he studied microprocessor architectures, along with meteorology and fluid dynamics. He became fascinated with the challenge of rendering the continuous currents of the atmosphere in the discontinuous, 0-or-1 world of computer code.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, Taiwan was a dictatorship, and Lin joined student groups opposed to the regime. After college, he faced several years of mandatory military service. He aced his entry test and assumed he would land a cushy engineering job in Taipei. Instead, he was shipped to the Matsu Islands, 16 kilometers from the Chinese mainland. He was hardly a model soldier. He hated having to recite party doctrine during assemblies. &#8220;You had to pretend, and say something not in your heart,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n<p>Taiwan didn&#8217;t seem to have a place for him, so in 1983 he enrolled in the aerospace engineering department at the University of Oklahoma, one of the only schools he could afford. He wanted to be a rocket scientist. But it was a tough transition. He cared more about learning computer languages than English, and felt isolated. His accent is a barrier, but not the only one. &#8220;Some folks tend to have a difficult time following S. J.,&#8221; says Bill Putman, a meteorologist at NASA&#8217;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and another longtime collaborator. &#8220;But it&#8217;s not necessarily a language barrier. It&#8217;s more a knowledge barrier.&#8221; Seeing his talent for computational fluid dynamics, his adviser suggested Lin switch to Princeton University, which with its partnership with GFDL is a hotbed for atmospheric modeling.</p>\n\n<p>He learned how GFDL scientists divided the air into a 3D grid that spanned the globe and stretched from the surface to the stratosphere, following lines of latitude and longitude. Along points on the grid, they would set initial conditions&#8212;the weather or climate for a given moment in time. Then, point by point, the computer would solve equations describing changes in wind, air pressure, temperature, and humidity for successive steps in time. Computers were room-sized mainframes at the time, and the model grids were huge, with a mesh size of 500 kilometers. The models could recreate only the largest atmospheric features, like jet streams and the Hadley cell, the belt that circulates warm air from the equator to the subtropics.</p>\n\n<p>After graduate school, Lin decided to stay in the United States. &#8220;I&#8217;m now more American than I am Taiwanese,&#8221; he says. He drinks whisky, but infuses it with ginseng. He returned to the University of Oklahoma as a postdoc to work on modeling tornadoes. But computers couldn&#8217;t yet model events that unfold at such small scales. The failure was humbling, and Lin says it provided a mantra: &#8220;Choose the right level of complexity for the particular problem, at the time that you have the resources to do it.&#8221; Lin soon found the right problem at NASA.&#160;</p>\n  \n  <div class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-image">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ma_0414_NF_SJLin_tornado_NEW_700px.jpg?itok=Ee9FTpFx" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ma_0414_NF_SJLin_tornado_NEW_700px.jpg?itok=Ee9FTpFx 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/ma_0414_NF_SJLin_tornado_NEW_700px.jpg?itok=HpHgxBnv 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption">\n  \n      <p>At high resolution, Lin&#8217;s model can simulate tornadoes, such as the 2013 twister in Moore, Oklahoma, that killed 24 people.</p>\n  \n</div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      VINCENT DELIGNY/AFP/GETTY IMAGES  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n  \n  \n      <p>In the late 1980s, Rood was working on the problem of the Antarctic ozone hole at Goddard. NASA was flying research planes into the hole to measure the chemicals that might be destroying it. These flights revealed a drop in several short-lived reactive nitrogen oxides, which allowed chlorine from humanmade chemicals to linger,&#160;priming further reactions that broke down the ozone. But Rood&#8217;s atmospheric models couldn&#8217;t simulate the flows and reactions. No matter what he did, the nitrogen reactants remained steady.</p>\n\n<p>How could that happen? At the time, an elegant mathematical solution had overtaken global modeling, called the spectral method. Rather than solving at points on a latitude-longitude grid, scientists realized that fluid flow in the atmosphere could be represented as the sum of a series of hundreds of sinusoidal, crisscrossing waves. The code ran faster, and the results could be transformed back onto a regular grid. The spectral method still powers most global weather forecasts today, including at NWS. But the speed comes with a cost: When the waves are projected back into physical space, mass can gradually grow unbalanced. For weather models, which only run for days into the future, this is not a big deal. But for models of atmospheric chemistry and climate, which run for much longer periods, these distortions were a critical flaw.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately for Rood, a young Taiwanese scientist had written to him, lured by his publications. When Lin joined NASA in 1992 as a contractor, the two set out to build a model that, above all else, preserved mass. This first meant jettisoning the spectral method. It also meant upgrading from finite-difference modeling, which solves for points on a grid, to a finite-volume model, which solves for conditions averaged across each cell, or box, and is ideally suited for conserving mass because the calculations pass fluxes, or volumes, of material from one box to the next. Others had considered such a solution, but thought it too complex or computationally expensive.</p>\n\n<p>But Lin was a master of computational efficiency. Over a furious few years in the mid-1990s, he and Rood expanded their model beyond chemical transport&#8212;for which it remains the standard&#8212;to a fullfledged dynamical core fast enough to be used for climate models. Put a mote of dust in the air, says Paul Ginoux, an aerosol modeler at GFDL, who also worked with Lin at Goddard, &#8220;and this code will transport it at the right place, at the right moment. And that&#8217;s beautiful.&#8221; The name of the code was far more mundane. They called it &#8220;FV,&#8221; for finite-volume, and later FV3.</p>\n\n<p>Their work soon drew the attention of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, one of the country&#8217;s leading institutes for weather and climate science, which incorporated FV into its influential climate model. NASA&#8217;s climate laboratory in New York City adopted it as well. And in 2003, GFDL lured Lin away to upgrade FV and fold it into its global simulation. The results of these models, some of the top U.S. contributions to the United Nations panel on climate change, have informed much of what the public hears about global warming. And they&#8217;ve all had Lin&#8217;s innovations at their heart.</p>\n\n<p>There\'s a term of art at NOAA for the reactive way Congress finances weather research: &#8220;budgeting by disaster.&#8221; It&#8217;s rarely pretty, and it&#8217;s why the coming merger in atmospheric modeling will, at its root, be thanks to the calamities of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>In 2005, after NWS failed to forecast Katrina&#8217;s direct hit on New Orleans, Louisiana, until 2 days out, Congress set aside money to improve predictions of Atlantic hurricanes. As it happened, it was around this time that Lin walked into the office of his boss at GFDL, Isaac Held, and declared: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to revolutionize weather prediction.&#8221; Computers were now capable of processing boxes small enough to render hurricanes. More important, Lin had developed a key bit of physics needed for FV3 to forecast realistic hurricanes. Many global forecasting models operate using an assumption called the hydrostatic principle&#8212;where the gravity of the air in any box is exactly balanced by the upward force of the air pressure in the box below it. This works for coarse models, which cannot directly simulate the fine upward and downward flows in the real atmosphere. But recreating weather events like hurricanes and thunderstorms, where updrafts are important, requires breaking this hydrostatic principle. After a decade of mulling, Lin finally had an efficient way of incorporating nonhydrostatic flows into his code.</p>\n\n<p>He needed to test it. Frank Marks, who leads hurricane research at NOAA&#8217;s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami, Florida, was overseeing improvements for the regional hurricane model for the Atlantic basin. With a smaller area to model, Marks can afford to have fine-scale boxes. Lin convinced him to use Katrina dollars to buy extra supercomputer time. Run FV3 at a 1-kilometer resolution, Lin promised, and the finest details of cyclones would arise. Sure enough, the violent walls of a hurricane&#8217;s eye opened in his code.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="graphic entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-figure"><h3 class="graphic__header">Zooming in on storms</h3>\n  <div class="graphic__body">\n<p>The FV3 model divides the atmosphere into boxes and simulates conditions in each one.

BICKEL/<i>SCIENCE</i>; XI CHEN (PRINCETON UNIVERSITY); NASA&#8217;S GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure></figure><p>In 2014, when NOAA announced a competition to choose the &#8220;core&#8221; of the agency&#8217;s next-generation weather forecast system, Lin was ready.</p>\n\n<p>Five models were entered, including FV3. And by the summer of 2015, FV3 was one of two frontrunners, along with the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS), the globalized version of a long-standing system produced by NCAR and used by many researchers. They would be judged on their speed and accuracy in mimicking the atmosphere&#8217;s flows.</p>\n\n<p>For 6 months, Lin&#8217;s placid office turned frenetic, as his team worked nights and weekends to embed FV3 within the weather service&#8217;s system. &#8220;There was never a time where I thought we were losing the battle on scientific ground,&#8221; Lin says. One advantage of his model was efficiency. It is Lin&#8217;s obsession&#8212;and not just at work: When Hurricane Sandy knocked out power at Lin&#8217;s modest home, he refused to use a normal generator, and instead rigged his Prius up to his home wiring. Its battery, he explained, would make certain any extra electricity the car&#8217;s generator churned out wouldn&#8217;t go to waste.</p>\n\n<p>So that FV3 could make efficient use of limited computing power, Lin and his team had written the code to work in parallel. This is hard for global models, where the weather in one box can influence another box a hemisphere away. But this interconnectedness isn&#8217;t as big a problem in the vertical dimension, so Lin enabled FV3&#8217;s layers to be detached from each other and be processed in parallel. He won additional efficiencies by changing the shape of the grid. Climate models are plagued by the so-called pole problem, the result of the strangely squished and stretched boxes near the poles. So Lin and Putman, his former&#160;NASA colleague, abandoned the latitudelongitude system in favor of a cubed sphere. Picture a six-sided die inflated like a balloon. There were no more poles to handle, just six square panels, with tricky interactions at the seams.</p>\n\n<p>The net result: compared with MPAS, FV3 took a third as many computer processors to run at operational standards. It also scaled more efficiently to a vast number of processors, and it could zoom in to model one part of the globe at high resolution without skewing its performance in coarser regions. It was a slaughter. NCAR withdrew its model before NOAA anointed FV3 as the winner, in July 2016. &#8220;There was just never any conclusive evidence that MPAS had an advantage that was worth the cost,&#8221; says Michalakes, who led the computing comparisons.</p>\n\n<p>During the competition, Lin had complained that NOAA was biased in favor of MPAS; now, he crows about his victory. &#8220;Most people in that discipline paid no respect to what we had been doing,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They found out the hard way.&#8221; With NCAR toppled, Lin now faces far bigger rivals: the United Kingdom&#8217;s Met Office, which since the early 1990s has been the only center to have merged its weather and climate forecasts, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts, which has long run the top-rated weather model.</p>\n\n<p>This time around, he&#8217;ll need help.</p>\n\n<p>European modelers start with the same set of balloon, satellite, and ground measurements as everyone else. But they cleverly inject randomness into these initial conditions, then do multiple runs to come up with a &#8220;consensus&#8221; forecast. Getting the United States up to those standards will require winning over U.S. researchers to provide innovative techniques that Lin and his colleagues can adapt for their model.</p>\n\n<p>Yet there&#8217;s a risk that academic weather scientists will avoid using FV3 and instead stick with MPAS, more comfortable with its origins and documentation, says Cliff Mass, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. Lin&#8217;s reluctance to break down his code in the past has heightened concerns. &#8220;Lin is a brilliant modeler,&#8221; Mass says. &#8220;He&#8217;s not big on community support.&#8221; But Putman believes Lin will embrace true improvements. &#8220;If he sees something that will push this code beyond where it is now, I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s willing to adapt.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>At a workshop next week, NWS will lay out its aggressive timetable for turning on FV3. By this May, FV3 ought to be fully wired into the service&#8217;s data assimilation. And by the first half of 2018, if all goes well, NOAA will flip the switch, making it the standard forecast that feeds into all of our phones.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Lin&#8217;s team continues to tinker with FV3. They&#8217;re honing a more powerful zooming technique: allowing the grid to create nests of high-resolution boxes, 2 to 3 kilometers a side, over regions of interest. This could allow high-resolution hurricane forecasts to be run at the same time as global predictions, with no need to wait for the global run to finish. And it could capture tornado outbreaks and severe storms, weather that has been too finegrained for existing global models. &#8220;We&#8217;re kind of ambitious,&#8221; Lin says. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to cover everything.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>On a screen at GFDL, Lucas Harris, Lin&#8217;s deputy, zooms in on Oklahoma, where a nested FV3 grid is recreating the events of May 2013. It was that month that a severe twister plowed through Moore, Oklahoma, killing 24. As the model runs, scattered storms organize into a line of squalls. Then anvil clouds form&#8212;the thunderstorm cells from which tornadoes would touch down on Moore. Next, Harris changes the place and time, to the eastern United States in June 2012, when a bow of thunderstorms&#8212;a so-called derecho&#8212;caught forecasters off guard and in some areas knocked out power for a week. The model sees traces of the storm nearly 3 days in advance. &#8220;Previously,&#8221; Harris says, &#8220;it was believed there was only 12 hours of predictability to this event.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>So far these results have stayed in the lab, but Lin is doing his best to spread the gospel. For the 2017 hurricane season, his prototype will run alongside existing regional hurricane models. And next month, Lin will return to Oklahoma for the &#8220;Spring Experiment,&#8221; a research jamboree of severe storm scientists, to test how the zooming technique could help local forecasters.</p>\n\n<p>All this collaboration, this dependence on outside contributions, makes Lin nervous. His model is moving out of the lab into the messy real world. Will it become the bedrock of all weather and climate prediction, from tornadoes next week to temperature rises next decade? &#8220;I&#8217;m cautiously optimistic, but not overly optimistic,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n<p>A good omen comes the next morning. Snow blankets Princeton&#8212;beautiful, but also manageable. Nearly 6 inches fell, not a foot or more. GFDL could have stayed open. Over the ether, Lin can&#8217;t resist a final comment. &#8220;The snow,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;is not as bad as forecasted.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Take that, Europe.

For most of his career, the microbiologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, paid the discipline little attention, but he did notice the <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf">field-shaking 2009 report</a> from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), which found that many forensic techniques, from fingerprint comparisons to bloodstain pattern analysis, lacked a firm scientific footing. &#8220;I remember reading [NAS] about this and I said, &#8216;Oh my God, I thought fingerprints had been validated,&#8217;&#8221; he remembers.</p>\n\n<p>He would soon play a direct role in the field&#8217;s reform, as one of a handful of basic researchers invited to serve alongside lawyers, judges, and forensic practitioners on a panel, created by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), in partnership with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to advise DOJ on how to respond to the NAS report&#8217;s concerns. Since its founding in 2013, the panel has published 43 documents and made 20 official recommendations to the attorney general, including a call for the universal accreditation of forensic practitioners and for the phasing out of the meaningless phrase &#8220;reasonable scientific certainty&#8221; that is common in courtrooms.</p>\n\n<p>Last week, Casadevall and five other scientific members of the commission <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3549346/Scientists-on-national-commission-urge-panel-be.pdf">wrote a letter</a> to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and acting National Institute of Standards and Technology Director Kent Rochford asking them to renew the group&#8217;s charter, set to run out 23 April. Instead, Sessions and DOJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/956146/download">announced on Monday</a> that the charter would be allowed to expire, and he requested proposals for a new advisory committee or an office within DOJ that would advance forensic science&#8212;a move many fear will exclude mainstream scientific views from future policy decisions.&#160;</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>Casadevall spoke to <cite>Science</cite>Insider about the commission&#8217;s value, its limitations, and what he expects to be its legacy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What was the logic behind this panel?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A: </strong>If you think about it, the techniques that formed forensic science were created to try to do criminal investigations. &#8230;&#160;Their ancestry is out of the mainstream of science, in the sense that they were developed for the purpose of trying to help solve crimes, and consequently, many of these techniques never got validated.&#160;&#8230; The big innovation of the commission was that you had mainstream scientists sitting at the table with judges, prosecutors, and forensic [practitioners]. &#8230; We [scientists] were there because science has traditions and approaches that transcend disciplines. Even though our domains are very different, our approaches to inquiry, our approaches to error, are pretty similar.</p>\n\n<p>The first five meetings of the commission, very little got done because we were trying even to learn to talk to one another. We come from completely different worlds. Law works as a dichotomy&#8212;you&#8217;re guilty or not guilty. In science, all knowledge is provisional. I assume that what we&#8217;re doing in my lab today is going to be overturned in the future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What do you see as the key products of the commission?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A: </strong>I think the document that was voted on in September [2016] stating that new techniques of forensic science need to be independently validated is a really important line in the sand. &#8230; Today, if you develop a new technique to characterize white powders, and you start a company, you can actually sell this to police departments without necessarily going through any [validation] mechanism &#8230; and then use it in court, in a situation in which the lawyers don&#8217;t know any of the science. So who is going to challenge any of this?</p>\n\n<p>The recommendation was that it should go to an independent entity that is not part of the justice department. &#8230;&#160;And to me, that is probably the single most important output of the committee. That at least is on record.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What about all the existing techniques that are still used in court and haven&#8217;t been validated, such as bite mark evidence?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Of course, we wanted [the document] to be bigger. We wanted it to be retrospective. But we had to compromise to get the votes. &#8230; We were a deliberative body and we need to get a product out, and if you dig your heels and say all of it needs to be independently validated, you couldn&#8217;t even get that statement.</p>\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t put the genie back in the bottle. The questions are out there. The Innocence Project, for example, is training lawyers on what questions to ask [about certain] techniques. We have an adversarial system. Inevitably, the pressure is going to come in, even from the prosecutors who say, &#8220;Hey guys, we&#8217;ve got to fix these techniques, because every time I present this, they hit me with these questions.&#8221; &#8230; There is a greater awareness now that if you&#8217;re going to introduce any of these things into court, you may be asked, &#8220;Where is your error rate? How do you really know what a match is? What does that mean?&#8221; I&#160;tend to look at this as progress.</p>\n\n<p>On Monday [at the commission&#8217;s final meeting], there were two documents that were voted down. &#8230; One of the documents was just to recommend that when somebody testified, if you asked them about an error rate, they should be able to tell you that they had it, or that they didn&#8217;t know. I think that if I stopped somebody on the street and I asked them, most people would agree that this is a reasonable thing. But some of the people &#8230;&#160;felt that this recommendation would be used by defense lawyers to question a lot of [forensic] practitioners. If we had continued to meet, those documents would have gone back to committee &#8230; and they would have figured out a way to work around &#8230; and they may have passed in the summer meeting or the fall meeting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Did you expect the commission&#8217;s charter to be renewed?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A: </strong>The truth of the matter is we did not know. We knew it was a congressional charter and Congress had basically appropriated money to run the commission a certain number of cycles. We thought that with the new administration, there was a high probability that perhaps it didn&#8217;t get renewed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Why wouldn&#8217;t DOJ support continuing the commission?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Sessions&#8217;s statement doesn&#8217;t say anything bad about science. They basically say that we&#8217;re going to take this and we&#8217;re going to put it back in the Department of Justice, create a new office of forensic science. On the surface, that sounds good. You could imagine that they could create an office with a lot of scientific input. &#8230; The problem of forensic science is that it grew out of an arm of the judiciary, and by putting it back, you basically don&#8217;t deal with the questions that are being asked from mainstream science. &#8230; The commission was the only mechanism that existed where you had working scientists talking to people who actually do forensic science to generate data that is consumed by the legal system. And we were a minority.</p>\n\n<p>I served on the anthrax investigation&#8212;the National Academy of Sciences study that was done on [<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2008/09/fbi-request-scientific-review-its-anthrax-investigation">the 2001 anthrax mailings</a>]&#8212;so I can tell you that the culture of criminal justice feels very uncomfortable when you question their techniques. And that is natural. These people are trying to reduce crime by putting people away. And here you have a situation in which techniques that they have used for many, many years come into question, and I think there is natural instinct to say, &#8220;Oh, God.&#8221; Some of that may have been there. But there are also a lot of people who recognize that these problems aren&#8217;t going away. And the way to deal with this is to do the science.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Q&amp;A: The U.S. Department of Justice scrapped independent forensics panel, but the scientific questions &#8216;are not going away&#8217;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

But hundreds of attempts helped few patients. Now, a new approach that tailors a personalized vaccine to the mutated proteins in an individual&#8217;s tumor appears to have prevented early relapses in 12 people with skin cancer. It also may have helped several others by boosting the power of a new type of cancer drug that uses a different mechanism to unleash an immune attack on the tumor.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in this very exciting, new moment&#8221; for personalized cancer vaccines, says Catherine Wu of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, whose team presented results last week at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Washington, D.C. A second team has similarly encouraging data. The two small studies, mainly designed to test safety and immune responses, are indeed &#8220;promising,&#8221; says Drew Pardoll of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. But, he cautions, it is &#8220;way too early&#8221; to draw firm conclusions about whether the vaccines will extend the lives of cancer patients.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas earlier, unsuccessful cancer vaccines usually targeted a single distinctive cancer protein shared among patients, these new ones contain multiple mutated proteins, or &#8220;neoantigens,&#8221; that are specific to an individual patient&#8217;s tumor. Giving patients a dose of their tumor neoantigens, which look foreign to the immune system, should help activate immune cells called T cells to attack the cancer cells.</p>\n\n<p>A study <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/04/personalized-cancer-vaccines-may-fight-tumors">published 2 years ago in <cite>Science</cite></a> suggested the strategy might work: It showed that a neoantigen vaccine stimulated immune responses in three advanced melanoma patients who had already received a cancer drug. But at the time researchers couldn&#8217;t say much about whether the vaccine would help curb cancer growth.</p>\n\n<p>One new study was conducted in six patients with melanoma that had spread to their lymph nodes and sometimes other sites. The patients&#8217; tumors had been removed surgically, but were likely to regrow. Wu&#8217;s team sequenced the DNA from each patient&#8217;s tumors and used computational methods to predict mutations that coded for neoantigens. Then they made each patient a personal vaccine containing about 20 of these neoantigens. The researchers injected the vaccine under the patients&#8217; skin periodically for 5 months. They had no serious side effects and showed &#8220;strong, potent T cell responses&#8221; specific to many of their vaccine neoantigens, says Wu, whose collaborator Nir Hacohen of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reported the results at the AACR meeting. All are now cancer-free up to 32 months later.</p>\n\n<p>The two patients with the most advanced disease did relapse, but Wu&#8217;s team deployed an additional weapon: an immunotherapy drug called a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor. These antibody drugs <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/05/cancer-immunotherapy-takes-aim-mutation-riddled-tumors">block receptors on T cells that tumors use to hide from the immune system</a>. On their own, the drugs have vanquished tumors in people with certain cancers who otherwise had no hope. In metastatic melanoma they help up to 40% of patients, but in only 5% do tumors disappear completely. When the two relapsed patients in Wu&#8217;s study received a PD-1 inhibitor, their new tumors vanished.</p>\n\n<p>Similar results come from an international trial using a vaccine developed by Ugur Sahin of University Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany. The team injected RNA coding for up to 10 tumor neoantigens into the lymph nodes of 13 advanced melanoma patients whose tumors had been removed. Eleven remain cancer-free up to 26 months later, including two whose tumors reappeared, then shrank or were surgically removed, Sahin says. Another patient whose cancer returned received a PD-1 inhibitor and is also tumor-free.</p>\n\n<p>Sahin&#8217;s and Wu&#8217;s results have been submitted for publication. Two of three patients from the first clinical test published 2 years ago are also in remission more than 2.5 years later, one after relapsing and then receiving a PD-1 inhibitor, says trial leader Gerald Linette of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>\n\n<p>Pardoll and others caution, however, that it&#8217;s not possible to know whether neoantigen vaccines perform better than a PD-1 inhibitor alone without doing larger studies. Other questions remain about how best to design and deliver neoantigen vaccines. Right now the vaccines are costly and take months to make, which may be too long for some patients with metastatic disease.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, several biotech companies are launching trials combining neoantigen vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors for various cancers, including Neon Therapeutics in Cambridge, which Wu and Hacohen co-founded.</p>\n\n<p>The Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy in San Francisco, California, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/qa-what-can-250-million-achieve-chief-new-cancer-immunotherapy-institute-explains">launched a year ago</a> by Napster co-founder and biotech billionaire Sean Parker, is trying to figure out how to tailor the best possible vaccines through a competition. Thirty companies and academic groups will receive the same set of tumor samples from individual patients and will try to predict the best neoantigens. The Parker Institute and another sponsor will test them with lab assays, then feed back the results so participants can improve their algorithms. Says Parker Institute Vice President for Research Fred Ramsdell: &#8220;At the end, we&#8217;ll have a good idea of how to correctly pick neoantigens for a vaccine.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Personalized tumor vaccines keep cancer in check" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

That can&#8217;t be done with humans, but some people are natural knockouts&#8212;born missing one or more genes. Now, a look at the DNA of 10,500 Pakistanis has found more than 1300 genes that are knocked out without causing obvious medical issues. The results may help confirm why a new heart disease drug flopped in clinical trials, and why another new drug should work just fine.</p>\n\n<p>The study is the latest of several hunts for apparently healthy human knockouts that have included <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/03/one-thousand-genes-you-could-live-without">Iceland</a> and the United Kingdom. &#8220;The Human Genome Project gave us a parts list of 18,000 genes, and this project is trying to understand what missing a part means in terms of biological consequences,&#8221; says heart disease geneticist Sekar Kathiresan of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who co-led the study.</p>\n\n<p>In Pakistan, people often marry their first cousins. That raises the odds that a mother and father will both pass identical copies of a mutation in a specific gene to their children. (Unless the mutated gene is on a sex chromosome, both parental copies of a gene have to be disabled for a full knockout.) Kathiresan&#8217;s group sequenced the DNA of 10,503 Pakistanis who are participating in a long-term heart disease and diabetes study and found 1317 fully knocked-out genes. The team then looked for abnormalities in about 200 clinical blood biomarkers such as cholesterol.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature22034">Seven genes were disabled in at least two people</a> and clearly matched up with some biomarker change, such as unusually low insulin levels, the team reports today in <cite>Nature</cite>. One codes for an enzyme called Lp-PLA2 that has been linked to arterial plaque. Because higher blood levels of Lp-PLA2 correlate with more heart attacks, drug companies have already spent billions of dollars on Lp-PLA2&#8211;blocking drugs. But Pakistanis who lacked one or both copies of the gene didn&#8217;t have a lower risk of heart disease, which adds to <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160615102425.htm">other genetics studies that may explain why these drugs failed in the clinic</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the study found strong support for another heart disease drug target, a protein called ApoC-III that <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/10/why-lucky-few-can-eat-their-hearts-content">limits the body&#8217;s ability to metabolize fats called triglycerides</a>. Although Kathiresan&#8217;s team has studied people missing one copy of the <em>APCO3</em> gene, &#8220;we\'ve been looking for the past 4 years for humans who completely lack it.&#8221; They had found none in the United States and Europe, he says, but in Pakistan, his group identified a whole family where both parents and all nine of their children lack the <em>APCO3</em> gene.</p>\n\n<p>When the family members drank a fat-laden milkshake, their blood fat levels barely rose, suggesting they have little artery-clogging fat in their bodies and should be protected against heart attacks. The family also seemed perfectly healthy, so ApoC-III&#8211;blocking drugs now in clinical testing should be safe, Kathiresan predicts. The drugs could eventually join <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/03/20/what-pcsk9-is-telling-us-about-drug-discovery">another heart disease&#8211;preventing drug</a> that came out of the discovery of a healthy woman missing a gene called <em>PCSK9</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The Pakistani study is the first in which researchers tested some of the knockouts they had found to learn more about their health, says human geneticist David Van Heel of Queen Mary University of London, who last year published a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/human-knockouts-reveal-genes-we-don-t-need">smaller knockout study of British-Pakistanis</a>. Because these individuals are so rare, &#8220;we really all need to keep going to sequence more and more people,&#8221; he says. About 200,000 Pakistanis would be enough to find knockouts of about 8700 genes, Kathiresan&#8217;s team estimates. (Some of these genes are essential to early development, however, so a human knockout would never be born.)</p>\n\n<p>Kathiresan and others is now calling for a Human Knockout Project that would pool all the data coming out of these projects and other large population genetics studies in a single database. Co-author Daniel MacArthur of the Broad Institute will soon release a prototype containing knocked-out genes <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/a-radical-revision-of-human-genetics-1.20779">from a larger collection of human genomes called ExAC</a>. Eventually the plan is to make it possible for academic researchers&#8212;and drug companies&#8212;to reach out to the&#160;leaders of the original study so they can&#160;contact an individual knockout from the database and bring the person into a clinic for more testing.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Human &#8216;knockouts&#8217; may reveal why some drugs fail" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Every day these hunters raid termite nests to keep their colonies fed. But the ants have chosen a dangerous prey, and tussles with large soldier termites often lead to injury&#8212;limbs and antennae are sometimes lost on the battlefield. When researchers noticed that large ants called &#8220;majors&#8221; would pick up fallen soldiers and carry the live ones back to their nests, they decided to study the fate of the injured by marking them with paint. <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/4/e1602187">More than 90% of hurt ants recovered</a> to emerge from their nests and march again in future raids, the researchers report today in <cite>Science Advances</cite>. A secretion from an injured ant&#8217;s mandibles seemed to be the key to calling for help; even when perfectly healthy ants were doused in the chemical, majors came around to offer a free ride. But if no help came for an ant in need&#8212;too slow to keep up with its departing unit&#8212;that ant was almost a third more likely to get eaten by a predator or die of exhaustion on the way home. The number of ants needing rescue each day was roughly equal to the number of ants born, meaning rescues&#8212;and the distress pheromone that signals them&#8212;help colonies stay strong enough to fight another day.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Watch these ants rescue injured comrades from termite battles" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

When top researchers in Eastern Europe started joining high-power institutions in the West, the research suggests, their colleagues and students back home ended up with fewer cross-border connections. "I\'m quite surprised how big the effect is," says Paul Nightingale, a science policy expert at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who was not involved in the study. "These are worrying findings."</p>\n\n<p>The analysis is based on a natural experiment. In 2004, the European Union expanded by adding 10 member states, including Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. This made it much easier for people in these countries to find work and live in Western Europe. By tapping a government database on intra-European job moves, Alexander Petersen, a computational social scientist at the University of California, Merced, and his colleagues were able to infer the impact of the union\'s expansion on scientific mobility. The database records the international transfers of highly skilled workers, such as doctors and civil engineers, who need a professional certification in a new host country.</p>\n\n<p>It was easy to see the brain drain. Although most professionals hopped between neighboring countries, the percentage that left Eastern for Western Europe rose from 5% to 29% after 2005. Scientists aren\'t in the database, because they don\'t need government accreditation, but Petersen thinks the trend is likely the same. Other experts agree: "There is a lot of migration because of the high-quality infrastructure in universities in the West," says Peter Tindemans, secretary-general of EuroScience, a membership association of European researchers, based in Strasbourg, France. "Scientists gravitate to the places where they can do the best science." He says there is a similar pattern with European Research Council grants, which researchers can take along when they head to a new institution.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>To find out what happens when a researcher packs up for a new country, Petersen and his colleagues dug into a database of millions of scientific papers published between 1996 and 2012, looking at affiliations of the authors as a proxy for international research collaborations. After 2004,&#160;<a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/4/e1602232">the new member nations in the east experienced a drop in the proportion of papers published with international co-authors</a>&#160;(see chart), the team reports in the current issue of&#160;<cite>Science Advances</cite>.&#160;In contrast, this ratio increased in the older member nations. (Here\'s how the ratio was calculated: Papers were counted as an international publication in each country where a co-author was located. A paper with authors only from a single country was counted as a noninternational publication in that country.) In Poland, for example, the ratio of internationally co-authored papers fell from 33% in 2004 to 28% in 2011, whereas it rose from 28% to 43% in the United Kingdom.</p>\n  \n  <div class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-image align-right">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/Cosmopolitan_talent_Western_Europe_Eastern_Europe_chartbuilder.png?itok=ryPQYTLF" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/Cosmopolitan_talent_Western_Europe_Eastern_Europe_chartbuilder.png?itok=ryPQYTLF 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/Cosmopolitan_talent_Western_Europe_Eastern_Europe_chartbuilder.png?itok=9UHf77sl 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption">\n  \n      <p>Countries within Western Europe are publishing a higher proportion of papers with foreign co-authors, partly because new talent immigrated from Eastern Europe and brought existing networks of international collaborators.</p>\n  \n</div>\n      <div class="credit"></div>\n    </figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n  \n  \n      <p>What likely happened is "rather intuitive," the researchers write in their paper. When top scientists in Eastern Europe moved to institutions in Western Europe, they brought along their connections with scientists in other countries&#8212;say, a Hungarian molecular biologist with ongoing collaborations in France and Germany, who moves to the United Kingdom. "Good scientists tend to collaborate with other scientists abroad," says co-author Fabio Pammolli, an economist at the Polytechnic University of Milan in Italy. "This is part of the increasing integration of science." In addition, he notes, talented graduate students came to study in Western universities and built new contacts while working in internationally staffed labs. Meanwhile, their home countries had lost international connections.</p>\n\n<p>This migration and concentration of talent in research hubs is a natural part of scientific growth, the authors say. At the same time, they acknowledge that losing talent is bad for the home country. The tricky balance for policymakers is that the European Union wants its most gifted scientists to be able to chase opportunities and work in the best places, but it also wants equitable growth and development among its member nations&#8212;and having a strong science base is a proven part of economic development. "It\'s one of these traditional European problems," Tindemans says. "We will not find a clear answer."</p>\n\n<p>The European Union has tried to level the economic playing field by providing billions of euros as so-called Structural Funds to its less developed member nations. In the beginning, many funds were not spent well, Tindemans says, and the European Commission has since pushed for better accounting and for more of the funds to be invested in science and innovation. "If you spend it wisely, you could do great things with that money," Tindemans says, pointing to <a href="http://www.esfri.eu/success-stories/extreme-light-infrastructure-when-scientific-excellence-contributes-europe%E2%80%99s">new high-power laser facilities in Eastern Europe</a> that are being built largely with Structural Funds. But he says it will continue to be difficult for Eastern nations to compete with the advanced centers of research elsewhere. "It\'s impossible that you will have the same high-quality research universities all over Europe. There are too few people and not enough money."&#160;</p>\n\n<p>What is needed in the short term, the authors say, is more incentives for scientific talent to return to Eastern Europe after training and experience in the West. Petersen says the commission already has valuable programs that match scientists in Eastern Europe with Western institutions to build expertise, and fellowship programs for scientific mobility, such as the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/about/individual-fellowships_en">Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie actions</a>, include a &#160;mandatory 1-year return period.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Europe&#8217;s paradox: Why increased scientific mobility has not led to more international collaborations" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Now, it turns out that the jets contain hydrogen gas, a sign of ongoing reactions on the floor of that alien sea. Because such chemistry provides energy for microbial life on Earth, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/155">the discovery makes Enceladus the top candidate for hosting life elsewhere in the solar system</a>&#8212;besting even Jupiter&#8217;s Europa, another icy moon with an ocean. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t see microbes,&#8221; says Hunter Waite, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, and the lead author of a study published this week in <em>Science</em>. &#8220;But we saw their food.&#8221;</p>\n  \n  <figure class="figure__minimal entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-related-articles align-right"><article class="media media--var media--priority-2"><div class="media__icon">\n        \n  \n      <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/missions-last-hurrah-cassini-aims-solve-riddle-saturns-rings"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.sciencemag.org//www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/grid_thumb_-_290x163__16_9_/public/ca_0414NID_Cassini_Path_1280x720.jpg?itok=PbjRTulf" alt="An artist\'s conception of Cassini\'s orbit"></a>  \n      </div>\n    \n    <div class="media__body">\n              <h3 class="overline"></h3>\n      \n\n      \n      <h2 class="media__headline">\n        <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/missions-last-hurrah-cassini-aims-solve-riddle-saturns-rings">In mission\'s last hurrah, Cassini aims to solve riddle of Saturn\'s rings</a>\n      </h2>\n          </div>\n  </article></figure><p>In previous passes through the plumes, the Cassini team found organic molecules like methane and formaldehyde. A final pass in October 2015, just 48 kilometers above the surface, revealed something even more tantalizing: abundant hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>). The authors argue that it comes from hydrothermal activity on the ocean floor, perhaps seafloor vents like those on Earth that spew H<sub>2</sub>&#160;and support rich microbial life. It could be produced by water reacting with iron, or similar reactions baking out primitive organic molecules trapped in the rocky core.</p>\n\n<p>Waite and his colleagues were previously blind to hydrogen in the plumes because of surges of it created in their own instrument when water reacted with its titanium components. All the potential biases seem accounted for now, says Gabriel Tobie, a planetary scientist at the University of Nantes in France who was unaffiliated with the study. The high volume of hydrogen is a puzzle, as are spikes in its abundance, but it is not the only evidence of seafloor activity on Enceladus. In 2015, Cassini scientists studied particles from Saturn&#8217;s E ring, known to be fed by Enceladus&#8217;s plumes, and found tiny glass beads that could have only come from hydrothermal reactions. &#8220;These converging pieces of evidence tell us that something special is happening inside Enceladus,&#8221; Tobie says.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, NASA is pinning its hopes for life on Europa, with the $2 billion Europa Clipper planned for launch in the next decade. The Hubble telescope has seen signs of a plume on Europa erupting twice from the same spot, according to a study in this week&#8217;s issue of&#160;<em>The Astrophysical Journal</em>. But the signal is contested, and there&#8217;s no evidence yet of hydrothermal activity.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to second guess targets at all,&#8221; says Waite, who leads an instrument on the Clipper. But he thinks Enceladus is just begging to be sampled with a mission designed for the task.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Food for microbes abundant on Enceladus" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Adults from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean swim to the Sargasso Sea to reproduce, and their offspring take a few years to return the 6000 kilometers to their respective coastlines. How they get there has been an enduring mystery. Many biologists have assumed these newborns drift aimlessly until swept up into the Gulf Stream, but like a few other marine creatures, they may actually use Earth&#8217;s magnetic field to guide their course, marine biologists have now discovered.</p>\n\n<p>Some researchers question whether this sixth sense exists in the very youngest eels found in the Sargasso Sea, but if it does, &#8220;this study adds to the growing body of evidence that the magnetic sense may be an important component of fishes that make long migrations in the ocean,&#8221; says Michael Miller, an eel biologist at Nihon University in Fujisawa, Japan, who was not involved in the work. And if it holds up that newborn eels do more than drift aimlessly, the study&#160;paints a new picture: These&#160;young eels&#160;&#8220;may be the ultimate swimming machines,&#8221; he adds.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, researchers have found that a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/06/maverick-scientist-thinks-he-has-discovered-magnetic-sixth-sense-humans">magnetic sixth sense</a> exists, perhaps even in people, and is important in <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/02/scienceshot-chinook-salmon-navigate-gpshttp:/www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/02/scienceshot-chinook-salmon-navigate-gps">salmon</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2004/04/magnetic-maps-guide-migrating-turtles">sea turtle</a>, and <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/07/big-magnet-small-fish">trout</a> migrations. And some work indicates that adult eels also sense magnetic fields. But proving the same was true of juvenile eels was quite tricky, as these fish can be quite erratic in their behavior. That makes it hard to discern any patterns in their orientation, and thus they are difficult to test.</p>\n\n<p>To better quantify whether eels did tend to swim in a particular direction in response to a magnetic field, Lewis Naisbett-Jones, a marine biologist at University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, and Nathan Putman, a marine biologist from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory at the University of Miami in Florida, designed a 25-centimeter-wide underwater arena: a central chamber connected to a dozen outer sections, each representing 30&#176; on a compass. They tested so-called glass eels, which is what the juvenile eels transform into when they arrive in Europe. A movable wall kept the eel in the center until the magnetic field was turned on and testing began.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers simulated magnetic fields from different parts of the migration route, and the fish responded as if they knew where they were going. <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)30284-1">In the magnetic field that was the same as in the Sargasso Sea, most of the eels headed southwest</a>, showing they did head in a particular direction in response to the magnetic field. In the test using the magnetic field found in the Atlantic off North America, the eels turned northeast, showing that slightly different magnetic fields caused them to orient in a different way, the researchers report today in <cite>Current Biology</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We were not surprised to find eels have a magnetic map, but we were surprised to discover how well they can detect subtle differences in magnetic fields&#8221; Naisbett-Jones says.</p>\n\n<p>At first, the orientations were confusing&#8212;the eels weren\'t headed the most direct way home. Yet a computer model showed that the headings taken by the juvenile eels in the experiment would in fact make their migration more efficient, as they got the fish into the Gulf Stream faster and kept them in this current so that they headed to Europe.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Swimming the \'wrong\' direction for a bit gets them into the Antilles Current, which connects them to the Gulf Stream,&#8221; Putman explains. &#8220;So, with a little bit of work they can get a mostly free ride to Europe.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The oceanographic model "strengthens the overall findings,&#8221; says Miguel Baltazar-Soares, a marine biologist at Bournemouth University in Poole, U.K., who was not involved with the work.</p>\n\n<p>However, the study has a major flaw, several experts say. Eels undergo several major transformations. Newborns are not very eellike at all, being more like flattened gelatinous ribbons than rounded elongated fish, so it&#8217;s not clear that these newborns would have the same sensory capabilities of the juveniles tested, says Caroline Durif, a marine biologist at the Institute of Marine Research in Bergen, Norway. &#8220;I would also like to point out that none of the authors are recognized eel experts&#8212;the paper&#8217;s main authors have not focused on eels before in their research. Otherwise, they would have realized how absurd this study is.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>But Putman doesn&#8217;t think the use of older eels is a problem and assumes even newborns have this magnetic sense. Instead, he thinks that the novelty of finding a magnetic compass in eels &#8220;might rub some people the wrong way&#8221; because they had not discovered it before.</p>\n\n<p>Next, he hopes to demonstrate that adult eels also use magnetism to find their way to the Sargasso Sea.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Young European eels may use magnetic fields to guide them home" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Biologists analyzed data collected by citizen scientists between 1993 and 2012 about the numbers of 10 bird species that reach New Zealand and Australia. The numbers in species such as the gray-tailed tattler that don&#8217;t rely heavily on the mudflats remained about stable over that time, they discovered. But for the seven species of&#160;which at least 60% need to make this pit stop, numbers declined.

In contrast, the analysis found that total migration distance, body size, nonbreeding grounds location, and other factors have not contributed to this decline. Given the critical importance of these stopovers, the researchers call for greater international efforts to slow the mudflat loss. Already, 36 governments and other organizations have formed the <a href="http://www.eaaflyway.net/http:/www.eaaflyway.net/">East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership</a>, but they may not be able to act in time to save these birds, the researchers note.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Migrating shorebirds in danger, due to disappearing mudflats" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Consider gentoo penguins (<em>Pygoscelius papua</em>), which have a major breeding colony (image) on Ardley Island off the Antarctic peninsula. The orange-billed birds first appeared on the island about 6700 years ago, and previous studies indicate that the climate and sea surface temperatures in the region have been good to them thus far. But sediment cores drilled from a 7300-square-meter lake on the island&#8212;which today collects runoff that includes prodigious amounts of penguin guano as well as material eroded from the island&#8217;s bedrock&#8212;tell a different story. At three times since the birds arrived, major eruptions of a volcano on Deception Island, which lies about 120 kilometers away, have <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms14914">cloaked Ardley Island with centimeters-thick layers of ash</a> that later washed into the lake, the researchers report in <cite>Nature Communications</cite>. It&#8217;s not clear whether each of those ash layers chronicles a single large eruption or a closely spaced sequence of smaller ones. Regardless, guano-free followed by guano-poor sediments left in the wake of these three eruptions suggest that breeding penguins were wiped out&#8212;or abandoned the island for posteruption intervals ranging between 400 and 800 years. Thick layers of ash would have made it hard for the birds to breathe, compromised the immune systems of adult and hatchling penguins, and may have prevented adults from collecting pebbles that they needed to construct their nests, the researchers suggest.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Volcanic eruptions may have periodically wiped out Antarctic penguin colonies" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

The approach relies on small quantities of vapor released from the common explosive TNT. Previously, researchers engineered <cite>Escherichia coli </cite>(pictured), a bacterial species abundant in the environment and in mammalian intestines, to glow green upon detection of DNT, a byproduct of TNT. In a study published in <cite>Nature Biotechnology</cite> today, the same team reports on a small field test with mines buried in sand and soil, whose triggering mechanisms were removed. The scientists loaded about 100,000 DNT-detecting bacterial cells into a single bead made of polymers derived from seaweed and sprinkled these beads over the landmine site at night. Twenty-four hours later, they used a laser to remotely detect and quantify fluorescing bacteria from 20 meters away, mapping the location of the landmines. The researchers tell <cite>Science</cite> that they have since improved their system to detect the explosives in only 3 hours and are programming the bacteria to have a limited life span to ease qualms about permanently releasing genetically engineered microbes in the environment. The team is careful to note that its trial was preliminary. For now, the technique is limited to small areas, but in the future a faster laser attached to a drone could scan larger swaths of land. The bacteria will also need to be optimized to find mines buried in rougher terrain, or ones that use explosives besides TNT.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Glowing bacteria detect buried landmines" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

The question has been as difficult to answer as it has been controversial. Now, the largest brain-imaging study of its kind indeed finds some sex-specific patterns, but overall more similarities than differences. The work raises new questions about how brain differences between the sexes may influence intelligence and behavior.</p>\n\n<p>For decades, brain scientists have noticed that on average, male brains tend to have slightly higher total brain volume than female ones, even when corrected for males&#8217; larger average body size. But it has proved&#160;notoriously tricky to pin down exactly which substructures within the brain are more or less voluminous. Most studies have looked at relatively small sample sizes&#8212;typically fewer than 100 brains&#8212;making large-scale conclusions impossible.</p>\n\n<p>In the new study, a team of researchers led by psychologist Stuart Ritchie, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Edinburgh, turned to data from <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/uk-begins-worlds-largest-biomedical-imaging-study">UK Biobank</a>, an ongoing, long-term biomedical study of people living in the United Kingdom with 500,000 enrollees. A subset of those enrolled in the study underwent brain scans using MRI. In 2750 women and 2466 men aged 44&#8211;77, Ritchie and his colleagues examined the volumes of 68 regions within the brain, as well as the thickness of the cerebral cortex, the brain&#8217;s wrinkly outer layer thought to be important in consciousness, language, memory, perception, and other functions.</p>\n\n<p>Adjusting for age, on average, they found that women tended to have significantly thicker cortices than men. Thicker cortices have been associated with higher scores on a variety of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678742/">cognitive</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3985090/">general intelligence</a> tests. Meanwhile, men&#160;had higher brain volumes than women&#160;in every subcortical region they looked at, including the hippocampus (which plays broad roles in memory and spatial awareness), the amygdala (emotions, memory, and decision-making), striatum (learning, inhibition, and reward-processing), and thalamus (processing and relaying sensory information to other parts of the brain).</p>\n\n<p>When the researchers adjusted the numbers to look at the subcortical regions relative to overall brain size, the comparisons became much closer: There were only 14 regions where men had higher brain volume and 10 regions where women did.</p>\n\n<p>Volumes and cortical thickness between <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/04/123729">men&#160;also tended to vary much more than they did between women</a>, the researchers report this month in a paper posted to the bioRxiv server, which makes articles available before they have been peer reviewed.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s intriguing because it lines up with previous work looking at <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00096.x">sex and IQ tests</a>. &#8220;[That previous study] finds no average difference in intelligence, but males were more variable than females,&#8221; Ritchie says. &#8220;This is why our finding that male participants&#8217; brains were, in most measures, more variable than female participants&#8217; brains is so interesting. It fits with a lot of other evidence that seems to point toward males being more variable physically and mentally.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Despite the study&#8217;s consistent sex-linked patterns, the researchers also found considerable overlap between men and women in brain volume and cortical thickness, just as you might find in height.&#160;In other words, just by looking at the brain scan, or height, of someone plucked at random from the study, researchers would be hard pressed to say whether it came from a man or woman. That suggests both sexes&#8217; brains are far more similar than they are different.</p>\n\n<p>The study didn&#8217;t account for whether participants&#8217; gender matched their biological designation as male or female.</p>\n\n<p>The study&#8217;s sheer size makes the results convincing, writes Amber Ruigrok, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom who has studied sex differences in the brain, in an email to <cite>Science</cite>. &#8220;Larger overall volumes in males and higher cortical thickness in females fits with findings from previous research. But since previous research mostly used relatively small sample sizes, this study confirms these predictions.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Ruigrok notes one factor that should be addressed in future studies: menopause. Many of the women in the study were in the age range of the stages of menopause, and hormonal fluctuations have been shown to influence brain structures. That may have played some role in the sex differences noted in the study, she says.</p>\n\n<p>The controversial&#8212;and still unsettled&#8212;question is whether these patterns mean anything to intelligence or behavior. Though popular culture is replete with supposed examples of intellectual and behavioral differences between the sexes, only a few, like higher physical aggression in men, have been borne out by scientific research.</p>\n\n<p>For the moment, Ritchie says his work isn&#8217;t equipped to answer such heady questions: He is focused on accurately describing the differences in the male and female brain, not speculating on what they could mean.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Study finds some significant differences in brains of men and women" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Hiring by algorithm would give men and women an equal chance at work, the thinking goes, and predicting criminal behavior with big data would sidestep racial prejudice in policing. But a new study shows that computers can be biased as well, especially when they learn from us. When algorithms glean the meaning of words by gobbling up lots of human-written text, they adopt stereotypes very similar to our own.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think that AI is some fairy godmother,&#8221; says study co-author Joanna Bryson, a computer scientist at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom and Princeton University. &#8220;AI is just an extension of our existing culture.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The work was inspired by a psychological tool called the implicit association test, or IAT. In the IAT, words flash on a computer screen, and the speed at which people react to them indicates subconscious associations. Both black and white Americans, for example, are faster at associating names like &#8220;Brad&#8221; and &#8220;Courtney&#8221; with words like &#8220;happy&#8221; and &#8220;sunrise,&#8221; and names like &#8220;Leroy&#8221; and &#8220;Latisha&#8221; with words like &#8220;hatred&#8221; and &#8220;vomit&#8221; than vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>To test for similar bias in the &#8220;minds&#8221; of machines, Bryson and colleagues developed a word-embedding association test (WEAT). They started with an established set of &#8220;word embeddings,&#8221; basically a computer&#8217;s definition of a word, based on the contexts in which the word usually appears. So &#8220;ice&#8221; and &#8220;steam&#8221; have similar embeddings, because both often appear within a few words of &#8220;water&#8221; and rarely with, say, &#8220;fashion.&#8221; But to a computer an embedding is represented as a string of numbers, not a definition that humans can intuitively understand. Researchers at Stanford University generated the embeddings used in the current paper <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1162">by analyzing hundreds of billions of words on the internet</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of measuring human reaction time, the WEAT computes the similarity between those strings of numbers. Using it, Bryson&#8217;s team found that the embeddings for names like &#8220;Brett&#8221; and &#8220;Allison&#8221; were more similar to those for positive words including love and laughter, and those for names like &#8220;Alonzo&#8221; and &#8220;Shaniqua&#8221; were more similar to negative words like &#8220;cancer&#8221; and &#8220;failure.&#8221; To the computer, bias was baked into the words.</p>\n\n<p>IATs have also shown that, on average, Americans associate men with work, math, and science, and women with family and the arts. And young people are generally considered more pleasant than old people. All of these associations were found with the WEAT. The program also inferred that flowers were more pleasant than insects and musical instruments were more pleasant than weapons, using the same technique to measure the similarity of their embeddings to those of positive and negative words.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers then developed a word-embedding factual association test, or WEFAT. The test determines how strongly words are associated with other words, and then compares the strength of those associations to facts in the real world. For example, it looked at how closely related the embeddings for words like &#8220;hygienist&#8221; and &#8220;librarian&#8221; were to those of words like &#8220;female&#8221; and &#8220;woman.&#8221; For each profession, it then compared this computer-generated gender association measure to the actual percentage of women in that occupation. The results were very highly correlated. So embeddings can encode everything from common sentiments about flowers to racial and gender biases and <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/183">even facts about the labor force</a>, the team reports today in <cite>Science</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of cool that these algorithms discovered these,&#8221; says Tolga Bolukbasi, a computer scientist at Boston University who concurrently conducted <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6228-man-is-to-computer-programmer-as-woman-is-to-homemaker-debiasing-word-embeddings">similar work with similar results</a>. &#8220;When you&#8217;re training these word embeddings, you never actually specify these labels.&#8221; What&#8217;s not cool is how prejudiced embeddings might be deployed&#8212;when sorting r&#233;sum&#233;s or loan applications, say. For example, if a computer searching r&#233;sum&#233;s for computer programmers associates &#8220;programmer&#8221; with men, mens&#8217; r&#233;sum&#233;s will pop to the top. Bolukbasi\'s work focuses on ways to &#8220;debias&#8221; embeddings&#8212;that is, removing unwanted associations from them.</p>\n\n<p>Bryson has another take. Instead of debiasing embeddings, essentially throwing away information, she prefers adding an extra layer of human or computer judgement to decide how or whether to act on such biases. In the case of hiring programmers, you might decide to set gender quotas.</p>\n\n<p>People have long suggested that meaning could plausibly be extracted through word cooccurrences, &#8220;but it was a far from a foregone conclusion,&#8221; says Anthony Greenwald, a psychologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who developed the IAT in 1998 and wrote a <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/133">commentary</a> on the WEAT paper for this week&#8217;s issue of <cite>Science</cite>. He says he expected that writing&#8212;the basis of the WEAT measurements&#8212;would better reflect explicit attitudes than implicit biases. But instead, the WEAT embeddings more closely resemble IAT biases than surveys about racial and gender attitudes, suggesting that we may convey prejudice through language in ways we don&#8217;t realize. &#8220;That was a bit surprising,&#8221; he says. He also says the WEAT might be used to test for implicit bias in past eras by testing word embeddings derived from, say, books written in the 1800s.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, Byron and her colleagues have also shown that even Google is not immune to bias. The company&#8217;s translation software converts gender-neutral pronouns from several languages into &#8220;he&#8221; when talking about a doctor, and &#8220;she&#8221; when talking about a nurse.</p>\n\n<p>All of this work &#8220;shows that it is important how you choose your words,&#8221; Bryson says. &#8220;To me, this is actually a vindication of political correctness and affirmative action and all these things. Now, I see how important it is.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Even artificial intelligence can acquire biases against race and gender" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

The report&#8217;s key recommendation is that universities and scientific societies create, operate, and fund a new, independent, nongovernmental Research Integrity Advisory Board (RIAB). The board would serve as a clearinghouse to raise awareness of the issues, as an honest broker to mediate disagreements, and as a beacon to help institutions that lack the knowledge or resources to root out bad behavior and foster good behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Other entities are already doing these things, but none has research integrity as its sole focus nor covers so much territory. Federal funding agencies investigate and punish miscreants who misuse taxpayer dollars, universities train scientists as part of their mission to advance knowledge, and scientific societies and journals have adopted ethical standards for their authors and members. After reviewing that landscape, the committee concluded that all of those organizations need to step up their game.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t think the system is broken, but we think there is a lot more we as a community can do,&#8221; says Robert Nerem, professor emeritus of bioengineering at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta and chair of <a href="http://www8.nationalacademies.org/cp/projectview.aspx?key=49387">the committee that wrote the report.</a></p>\n\n<p>And Nerem doesn&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any time to waste. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t do better, Congress could step in&#8221; and act unilaterally, he warns. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t think Congress [would have] the best interests of the research enterprise at heart in moving forward. Some legislators are champions of research, but I would be leery of what would come out of Congress.&#8221;</p>\n\n<h2>A long, hard slog</h2>\n\n<p>The committee began its work in 2012 with the goal of updating a 1992 National Academies&#160;report, <em><a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/1864/responsible-science-volume-i-ensuring-the-integrity-of-the-research">Responsible Science</a></em>, which made a similar pitch for an advisory body. (It went unheeded.)&#160;The 1992 report was prompted by a wave of research misconduct cases that soiled science&#8217;s reputation and led to the creation of the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) to investigate misconduct involving federally funded biomedical research.</p>\n\n<p>But what began as a 2-year project wound up taking quite a bit longer. &#8220;The research enterprise has grown a lot in the past 25 years,&#8221; Nerem says, adding that the rise in interdisciplinary research, new technologies, concerns about reproducibility, and increased international collaboration have made research integrity a much more complex issue. The committee almost&#160;ran out of money at one point, and the exhaustive internal vetting process given every Academies&#160;report took even longer than usual.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the widespread adoption of ethical standards by the scientific community, research misconduct continues to be a thorn in the side of the scientific community. ORI and its counterpart at the National Science Foundation (NSF) receive hundreds of allegations every year, which result in dozens of findings of misconduct.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than hiding its head in the sand, the committee decided that self-examination might help the community do its job better. An appendix to its report includes five notorious cases, including one several years ago at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/11/potti-found-guilty-research-misconduct">involving fabrication by cancer researcher Anil Potti</a>, in which Nerem says the school&#8217;s response to allegations of misconduct was as flawed as the behavior itself. &#8220;As good a research institution as Duke is, clearly, they fell down on the job,&#8221; Nerem says.</p>\n\n<p>Although ORI concluded the Potti investigation in 2015, Nerem says he&#8217;s not convinced the institution has learned its lesson. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if Duke has changed its practices, but it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if it happened again,&#8221; he says. &#8220;After all, people are only human.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The best way to reduce the number of such ugly incidents, Nerem believes, is for top university officials to make clear that training in the responsible conduct of research (RCR) is a priority at their institution. And that&#8217;s where the proposed advisory board could help.</p>\n\n<p>A creation of the community, the RIAB would &#8220;have no direct role in investigations, regulation, or accreditation,&#8221; the report says. Nor would it set enforceable standards for the profession. But Nerem and others believe that the board&#8217;s focus on fostering ethical behavior could encourage institutions to pay more attention to the issue.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="graphic entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-figure"><h3 class="graphic__header">Less than the best</h3>\n  <div class="graphic__body">\n<p>A new review of 91 universities found that few require more than an online course for research ethics training.</p>\n</div>\n\n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/gg_SVG_RIR_4%20%281%29.png?itok=C4jaQ9Er" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/gg_SVG_RIR_4%20%281%29.png?itok=C4jaQ9Er 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/gg_SVG_RIR_4%20%281%29.png?itok=o4IdlsWA 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption"></div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      CREDITS: (GRAPHIC) G.

(and former&#160;<cite>Science</cite>&#160;editor-in-chief), thinks the board could be especially helpful to small institutions. &#8220;I see it as the great equalizer,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Big research organizations are well-oiled machines, but a smaller organization may not know how to proceed with an investigation or create an RCR training program.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Another way to improve the quality of investigations would be to subject them to external peer review. &#8220;We do it for journal articles, and for grant proposals, so why not use outside experts on investigations as well?&#8221; Nerem asks.</p>\n\n<p>The committee looked at various mechanisms for establishing the board and decided that it should sit outside the federal umbrella. &#8220;Most universities feel they are already being micromanaged by the government, and having this board be part of [the federal bureaucracy] might reinforce that,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n<p>McNutt sees another reason for its independence. &#8220;The federal government has been slow to adopt best practices on research integrity,&#8221; she says. &#8220;So I&#8217;m not surprised that the committee feels that it would be better for the board to be independent.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The makeup and location of the board would be up to its founding members, who would also finance its operations. The panel proposed that the board have an annual budget of $3 million, with the money coming from federal agencies, foundations, and universities. Academic institutions would pay dues on a sliding scale based on how much research they perform.</p>\n\n<p>McNutt says that the National Academies might consider a request to provide physical space for the board but that otherwise her organization would remain at arm&#8217;s length. That would also allow the Academies to carry out an independent evaluation of the board&#8217;s activities if it were asked to do so, she adds.&#160;</p>\n\n<h2>More than a checklist</h2>\n\n<p>Coincidentally, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-017-9883-5">a new study in <em>Science and Engineering Ethics</em></a> highlights some gaps in training that the board might address. In 2007, Congress ordered NSF&#160;to require every grant application to include a plan for RCR training of all postdoctoral researchers, undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers who would be participating in the proposed research. But the study finds that most universities have adopted bare bones programs that appear tailored to simply comply with the requirement rather than to truly educate the next generation of scientists by following best practices in the field. Most consist of online instruction rather than face-to-face interaction (see graph, above), deliver a single &#8220;dose&#8221; rather than ongoing ethics training, and take a one-size-fits-all approach that doesn&#8217;t differentiate by discipline or the student&#8217;s academic status.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;If you think of [RCR] as compliance, you&#8217;re missing the boat,&#8221; says medical ethicist Elizabeth Heitman of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, a co-author of the study. &#8220;The problem is that it&#8217;s become a checklist.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The authors suggest that NSF also shoulders some responsibility for the current situation. NSF doesn&#8217;t require institutions to document that they are actually providing the training, giving them broad latitude to design their programs. Nor does NSF do any systematic monitoring of those efforts. In response, an agency spokesperson says that &#8220;NSF believes that &#8230; education in [RCR] is essential in the preparation of future scientists and engineers.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Heitman believes the fundamental problem is that many universities view ethics training as an add-on rather than as part of their core mission. That leads to a cascade of poor practices, she says, including leaving the training to others, doing it on the cheap, and dropping it when a funding agency no longer requires it to win a grant. &#8220;We don&#8217;t outsource biostatistics or biochemistry education, but we think differently about ethics and research integrity,&#8221; she laments.&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n<p>The impact of federal research policies on research integrity could be another ripe area for the new board to examine, notes the Academies&#160;report. Increasing competition for funding and the need for high-profile publications in order to win academic promotion can generate &#8220;detrimental research practices&#8221; that fall short of the federal definition of misconduct as fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism but nevertheless stray from acceptable norms.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The ultimate goal of the board,&#8221; says McNutt, &#8220;would be to create a climate in which we never have to investigate research misconduct because it never occurs.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="U.S. report calls for research integrity board" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Soon after that text, Weinberg and two other march enthusiasts she met online found themselves leading a global movement that has attracted millions of followers, with goals that include dramatizing concerns that political leaders are ignoring scientific evidence and demonstrating broad support for science. To turn that vision into reality, the trio has recruited scores of volunteer coordinators, negotiated partnerships with dozens of science groups, and raised some $1 million to pay for everything from security to portable toilets.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Every step of the way has been completely terrifying,&#8221; Weinberg says. &#8220;&#8216;Seems like it would be pretty easy&#8217; will be on my tombstone,&#8221; she jokes.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>March organizers admit they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;ll find at the end of their exhausting sprint. They are uncertain of how many marchers will appear, and how the demonstrations will be received. But they also are already looking past 22 April. They see march day as a beginning, not an end, as March for Science tries to pivot from being an event organizer to becoming a lasting force for science advocacy.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building an organization that is going to last beyond the march,&#8221; says Jonathan Berman, a march co-chair and a postdoctoral fellow studying hypertension at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. The goal, he says, is to create a group that can help science advocates develop the organizing and lobbying skills they need &#8220;to make their concerns heard&#8221; and &#8220;have an effect on politics.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>March organizers kept that long-term goal in mind as they shaped the Washington, D.C., event. They chose speakers who they believed would highlight the value of a vibrant and diverse scientific community. Lydia Villa-Komaroff, a Mexican-American biologist who helped demonstrate how bacteria could make insulin, will speak to the role of basic research in producing valuable discoveries. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician who helped expose dangerous lead levels in Flint, Michigan&#8217;s drinking water, symbolizes the value of science-informed advocacy. TV personality Bill Nye has become an icon of creative efforts to get young people excited about science. March planners also arranged teach-ins, including one on the science of superheroes, with the goal of getting march attendees excited about reaching out to their own communities upon returning home. And 22 April will kick off a &#8220;week of science action,&#8221; during which organizers will encourage marchers everywhere to maintain the momentum through small actions, such as posting social media messages on specific themes.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the organizers steered clear of politicians, desiring a nonpartisan atmosphere. The goal was to create &#8220;as big of a tent&#8221; as possible, says anthropologist Valorie Aquino, the third march co-chair and a Ph.D. student at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.</p>\n\n<p>March organizers are hoping for a large turnout on 22 April, but&#8212;like any good scientist&#8212;they say further evaluation will be necessary before they can draw conclusions about the event&#8217;s success. Increased advocacy from the scientific community and more science-based evidence in policy decisions could take years to come about, they concede.</p>\n\n<p>But they aren&#8217;t waiting long to take their next step. The day after the march, organizers plan to meet in Washington, D.C., with partners to discuss how March for Science can continue. Those discussions are likely to revisit many of the logistical challenges and politically sensitive issues that the group confronted over the past few months.</p>\n\n<p>Raising money, for instance, will remain a key challenge. Weinberg has dipped into her savings in order to work on the march full time. Aquino, who suspended her research to focus on the event, has been supporting herself by working as an online teaching assistant. Both would like to continue their science advocacy work through the March for Science organization. Weinberg hopes there will be just enough money leftover from march fundraising to help jump-start the group&#8217;s next steps. But funds have mostly come from individual donations and merchandise sales, which she fears will drop off after the march. (Fundraising has been complicated, she says, by vendors selling knockoff March for Science swag while falsely claiming to send proceeds to the organization.)</p>\n\n<p>The group will also have to decide how it will advocate for science without becoming too entangled in partisan politics. March critics have already noted that politically conservative scientists might not feel welcome in a group that tends to lean liberal. And others have hotly debated how the march has handled diversity issues. The organizers say that, more than aiming to advocate for a single issue, candidate, or party, they want to catalyze a cultural shift, erasing what they say many scientists see as an uncrossable line between science and advocacy. &#8220;I want scientists to get out of their comfort zone a little bit, to not leave data at someone\'s doorstep and walk away,&#8221; Aquino says.</p>\n\n<p>March organizers know they&#8217;re not the first to urge scientists to speak out&#8212;march partners AAAS (publisher of <cite>Science</cite>Insider), the Union of Concerned Scientists, and other groups have long pursued similar goals. But they note the march has roused hundreds of thousands of grassroots advocates, including nonscientists, and say that failing to follow up with them would be a lost opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;If this whole thing ended after April 22,&#8221; says Weinberg, &#8220;I would consider the last two-and-a-half months of my life kind of wasted.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="On eve of science march, planners look ahead" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Fewer than 300 of these great cats remain in the forest, where they are confined to small patches of jungle surrounded by cities and farmland. So it was &#8220;the most beautiful thing in the world,&#8221; when Beatriz Beisiegel captured rare footage of a healthy female jaguar followed by her two cubs in December 2016 in Carlos Botelho State Park. The trio passed the camera trap not once, but at least three times, the last with full bellies. This is the first time that Beisiegel, a biologist with the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation in Bras&#237;lia, has seen a cub in her 12 years monitoring jaguars in the dense jungles of the Ribeira Valley, in southern S&#227;o Paulo state. The sighting is especially encouraging, given the constant threat of poaching in these encroached forests. Just last month, another jaguar was illegally shot and killed on nearby private lands by hunters who bragged about the deed in a <a href="http://g1.globo.com/sp/santos-regiao/noticia/2017/03/cacadores-matam-onca-debocham-do-animal-e-video-causa-revolta-veja.html">viral internet video</a>. Beisiegel says she hopes her videos will inspire others to protect jaguars and reject a bill currently moving through the Brazilian Congress that would legalize the sport hunting of wild animals. Appropriately enough, she has&#160;given an apt name to the female jaguar: Hope.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="This rare footage of jaguar cubs is inspiring hope for Brazil&#8217;s endangered cat" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

This team may have the answer</h1>  <p class="byline byline--article">\n  By <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/author/ula-chrobak">Ula Chrobak</a><time>Apr. 11, 2017 , 7:15 PM</time></p>\n</header><p>It&#8217;s the bane of tennis shoe wearers everywhere: No matter how tightly you tie your laces, they seem to come undone, often at the most inopportune time. Now, for the first time, scientists have untangled why shoelace knots fail. The work also reveals the best knots to tie and could have implications for everything from surgery to new cancer drugs.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We deal with them coming untied all the time,&#8221; says Colin Adams, a mathematician at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, who was not involved with the study. &#8220;And yet, nobody&#8217;s ever taken the time to say: Why does it happen?&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s one thing we do know about shoelaces: The &#8220;square knot&#8221; holds up better than the &#8220;granny knot.&#8221; Both knots appear about the same, with two bunny-ear loops, but the granny tends to rotate to its side&#8212;one loop pointing up the shoe, the other down. (Still confused? Check out this&#160;<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/terry_moore_how_to_tie_your_shoes">TED video</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>To find out why even the best knots fail, Oliver O&#8217;Reilly, a mechanical engineer at the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues put a volunteer on a treadmill. The test subject tied her shoes with the weaker granny knot so that the researchers had a better chance of watching it unravel. The scientists attached accelerometers to her shoes to measure the acceleration, or g-force, the knot experienced with each stride.</p>\n\n<p>Using slow-motion video, the team uncovered two stages of knot&#160;slippage: a gradual loosening with each step, and a sudden &#8220;catastrophic failure.&#8221; When the knot started to unravel, it fell apart within two strides. The researchers were surprised by the g-force the knot experienced as it bobbed up and down, which was more than any rollercoaster can generate.</p>\n  \n  <div class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-image">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/shoelace_s_v_w.jpg?itok=HUfxFz3O" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/shoelace_s_v_w.jpg?itok=HUfxFz3O 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/shoelace_s_v_w.jpg?itok=9NrzMiXs 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption">\n  \n      <p>The team at the University of California,&#160;Berkeley, tested two types of knots to see which stayed tied longer.</p>\n  \n</div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      Christopher Daily-Diamond  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n  \n  \n      <p>Walking was key. The same knot that failed within 15 meters of walking stuck around if participants just stomped their feet on the ground or swung them while sitting on a table, the team reports today in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society</em>. <a href="http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rspa.2016.0770">Neither impact by itself&#8212;stomping or swinging&#8212;was enough to undo the knots</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We were able to see that these two combined effects lead to shoe knots failing,&#8221; O&#8217;Reilly says. &#8220;You need both together.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The scientists then designed an experiment to measure how long it took for knots to unravel and the rate at which the laces slipped. Working on a shoestring budget and borrowing lab equipment on weekends, the researchers designed a mechanical pendulum that smacked a plate. The pendulum&#8217;s swing approximated leg movements, and the smack the impact of shoes with the ground. The pendulum sported a shoelace with weighted ends&#8212;the added weight was needed to simulate how strongly the ends whip on runners&#8217; shoes. The team used this controlled setup to calculate the precise slip rate of shoelaces, tied either granny or square.</p>\n\n<p>The experiment confirmed the treadmill observations. Both knots initially slipped apart at a slow, gradual rate with each swing and smack of the pendulum. Eventually, though, the laces became loose enough to rapidly slip apart at a much faster rate. The study also demonstrated the superiority of the square knot. This winning knot failed about half the time (when weighted), whereas the granny knot always failed.</p>\n\n<p>But though the scientists know that one knot is more resilient, they still can&#8217;t explain why. It may have something to do with how the laces press against each other within the knot and the knot&#8217;s tension, Adams says. &#8220;If you could actually predict when a knot is going to fail,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that would have implications beyond shoelaces.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>This could include knots used in surgical sutures, on boats, and in mountaineering. But knots also exist on the microscopic level: DNA knots and unknots when it creates copies of itself, for example. Scientists are already exploiting these properties to create drugs that slow tumor growth.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Why do shoelaces untie themselves?

For sociologist Dana Fisher and a handful of other scientists who do survey research, however, the event will be another day at the office, as they plan to query those attending the demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>Fisher studies protests and climate politics. And on 22 April she will be leading a team of 16 faculty members and students from the University of Maryland in College Park who will commute to downtown Washington, D.C., to gather data from the crowd assembled on the National Mall for the flagship U.S. march. Fisher hopes that more than 500 people will complete a two-page survey asking what brought them to the event, their level of political activism, and the nature of their work.</p>\n\n<p>A different team, led by political sociologist Michael Heaney of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, also wants to explore the political identities of the marchers. Their approach will require a six-page survey, and Heaney says he&#8217;ll be ecstatic if 250 people wade through it.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>A third group wants to explore scientific norms, that is, what marchers think is appropriate political behavior by scientists. The four-person team, led by political scientist Michael Xenos of the University of Wisconsin in Madison and deployed by graduate student April Eichmeier, hopes to engage some 200 participants.</p>\n\n<p><cite>Science</cite>Insider has also identified a fourth group of researchers who hope to study the march without actually being there in person. The team, from nearby George Mason University (GMU) in Fairfax, Virginia, are asking organizers to help them recruit participants for a survey by sending out a note to the march\'s email list and social media followers.</p>\n\n<h2>Unprecedented opportunity</h2>\n\n<p>Scientists are no strangers to political activism. But the potential magnitude of this month&#8217;s marches&#8212;scheduled for hundreds of cities across the United States and around the world&#8212;may be unprecedented, says Scott Frickel, who studies mass mobilizations at Brown University and is part of Fisher&#8217;s group.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge for researchers is to understand what is driving people to act now and what their actions say about the status of science in today&#8217;s fractious political culture. &#8220;People are always upset about something,&#8221; Frickel says. &#8220;But they start movements when they see the possibility of losing what they have.&#8221; Fisher is predicting as many as 100,000 will show up at the Washington, D.C., march alone, if the weather cooperates.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers hope the data they collect will also give them a sense of what might happen next. &#8220;It&#8217;s the nature of mass mobilization,&#8221; Frickel says. &#8220;You get people in the streets, and then you figure out what you want to do.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Fisher has been doing surveys of large-scale climate protests for more than a decade. Though she specializes in environmental issues&#8212;the March for Science takes place on Earth Day&#8212;she also surveyed participants in this year&#8217;s postinaugural Women&#8217;s March on Washington.</p>\n\n<p>Her M4S instrument is based on the two-page questionnaire she used for that march. But it will contain seven additional questions&#8212;including one asking for the participant&#8217;s job title and another that requests a description of what they do at work&#8212;that are aimed at capturing the unusual demographics expected for the M4S. Although the survey is anonymous, it asks those willing to participate in a follow-up interview weeks or months later to provide contact information.</p>\n\n<p>What happens after 22 April is a less compelling question for Heaney, who studies how social movements and political party affiliation shape public policy. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure what I would make of the [follow-up] data if I asked,&#8221; he says. For Heaney, M4S offers a chance to use the science march to enrich his previous findings, such as studies showing that people tend &#8220;to abandon a movement rather than [to switch] parties.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>For example, his M4S survey asks participants to select from a list of 28 causes that might have prompted them to hit the streets at some point in their lives, from opposing the 1960s Vietnam War to Black Lives Matter and &#8220;stop Obama health care.&#8221; Fisher&#8217;s similar list of 11 topics is much shorter and asks participants to go back only a decade. It&#8217;s also more generic&#8212;the categories include peace and racial justice, for example&#8212;when dealing with the topic that prompted them to protest.</p>\n\n<p>Like his colleagues, Xenos wants to find out why people are attending the march, how they learned about it, and a bit about who they are. But he&#8217;s also interested in what they hope to accomplish, and what they think of scientists who adopt this form of political expression.</p>\n\n<h2>March madness methodologies</h2>\n\n<p>At the march, the survey takers will face the challenge of selecting participants from among the throng. All of the researchers are planning to use a variation of the standard technique for randomizing the process. Fisher&#8217;s team will plunge into the crowd and grab every fifth person, for example, whereas Heaney&#8217;s crew will start by spotting an &#8220;anchor&#8221;&#8212;a person who catches their eye for whatever reason&#8212;and then pick those who are five persons to the right and left of that individual.</p>\n\n<p>Once they find a willing subject, however, their methodology will vary. Fisher&#8217;s team will be armed with computer tablets, which they will hand over to marchers and then gently monitor their progress. It is way more efficient than using paper questionnaires, which later must be typed into computers, she says.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, Heaney will use the traditional clipboards, and Eichmeier&#8217;s crew will record the interviews, which they will later transcribe. Under survey rules approved by their university&#8217;s Institutional Review Board, the research teams won&#8217;t have to get written prior consent from their subjects because the subjects will not be identified in any way. And only those 18 and older will be asked to participate.</p>\n\n<p>Away from the march, the GMU team is taking a digital approach. Rather than in-person interviews, they are asking march organizers to help them query thousands of people who have expressed their support for the march via email&#160;or on social media. (The March for Science would not share its email or social media lists with the researchers; rather, it would let followers know the researchers are seeking their responses on a survey.)</p>\n\n<p>The GMU researchers realize that many of those people will not be scientists themselves.&#160;&#8220;The march is a unique opportunity to measure public perceptions of public engagement by scientists and the role of science in society,&#8221; says Teresa Ann Myers, a researcher at GMU&#8217;s climate change communications center that has proposed the study. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of talk about that online, but there isn&#8217;t much in the literature.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Jonathan Berman, an M4S co-chair, says the steering committee is reviewing requests from several researchers interested in contacting their supporters. &#8220;We\'re looking forward to working with social scientists who do know how to ask the right scientific questions to generate scholarly output about the march,&#8221; says Berman, a postdoc at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. Berman says that it&#8217;s unlikely any decisions will be made until after the march, however, a timeframe that Myers says &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t be a problem.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>High refusal rates are the bane of every survey researcher, and the willingness of participants to engage can vary greatly. Those attending this winter&#8217;s Women&#8217;s March on Washington were very receptive, says Fisher, with only 7.5% declining. That&#8217;s the lowest refusal rate ever for her, but she won&#8217;t be surprised if the M4S erases that record. After all, who better understands the value of doing research than a fellow researcher?</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Clarification, 4/13/2017, 11:21 a.m.:</strong> The story has been revised to clarify that the GMU researchers are not asking March for Science to share its email or social media lists with the researchers, but asking march organizers to distribute notice of a survey instrument on their behalf.</em></p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Examine thyself: Researchers set to study the March for Science" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Somewhere along the line, the ancestor of dinosaurs diverged from the ancestor of crocodiles, a momentous split in the evolution of vertebrates that ultimately set the stage for the age of dinos. But the details of that split remain mysterious, thanks to a dearth of fossils of early dinosaur relatives. Enter the newly identified 247-million- to 242-million-year-old <em>Teleocrater rhadinus</em>, a close relative of dinosaurs that also happened to walk on all fours and share some key features with the ancestors of crocodiles. These shared features, the authors say, suggest that it&#8217;s time to rethink what we thought we knew about dinosaurs&#8217; earliest ancestors.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been waiting a long time to find fossils like this that fit in this part of the family tree,&#8221; says Randall Irmis, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum of Utah in Salt Lake City, who was not involved in the work. &#8220;This has pretty big implications for how we understand the early evolution of dinosaurs.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Some 251 million years ago, at the end of the Permian period, a mass extinction wiped out most of life on Earth. In its wake arose a group of egg-laying reptile precursors called archosaurs, the common ancestors of dinosaurs, flying reptiles known as pterosaurs, and crocodiles. At some point during the next period, the Triassic, pterosaurs and dinosaurs split off from the crocodile lineage.</p>\n\n<p>Those two different lineages, avian versus crocodilian, have long been identified by their types of ankle joints. Dinosaurs and pterosaurs all have a version of a hinged, birdlike ankle, rather than the crocodilelike ankle with ball-and-socket joint.</p>\n\n<p>But exactly what early dinosaurs and their closest relatives looked like has been something of a mystery, because few fossils exist from the dawn of the dinosaurs. And many of the fossils that do exist, collected perhaps decades to a century ago, languish unidentified in museum drawers.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, <em>Teleocrater</em> isn&#8217;t a completely new discovery. A specimen was first unearthed in what is now Tanzania in the 1930s and sat in London&#8217;s Natural History Museum until 1956, when Ph.D. candidate Alan Charig (later a paleontologist at the museum) dubbed it <em>T. rhadinus</em> (referring to the shape of the animal&#8217;s hip and its slender body). Charig, who died in 1997 but is included as an author on the new paper, speculated that it was some sort of early dinosaur relative. But the fossil was in pieces, just bits of vertebrae and pelvis and limb, and difficult to place on the family tree.</p>\n\n<p>Then in 2015, Sterling Nesbitt, a paleontologist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University&#160;in Blacksburg, and a team of researchers headed back to southern Tanzania to take another look at the middle Triassic rocks where <em>Teleocrater</em> was first discovered. This time, the rocks&#8212;estimated to be about 247 million to 242 million years old&#8212;yielded several individuals of the same species. With that new bounty, the researchers were able to catalog many more of the creature&#8217;s features&#8212;enough to place it on the vertebrate family tree.</p>\n\n<p><em>Teleocrater</em>, Nesbitt and his co-authors report online today in <cite>Nature</cite>, <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature22037">belongs at the very base of the avian lineage that later gave rise to dinosaurs</a>. It has a characteristic muscle scar on the upper leg bone that is found only in the avian lineage of birds and dinosaurs and is missing in crocodiles and their relatives. But <em>Teleocrater</em> also had a crocodilelike ankle, with a ball-and-socket joint. That suggests that the crocodile ankle came first, and the bird ankle evolved later.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s key, because the ankle joint has been used for decades as an indicator of avian versus&#160;crocodilian lineage, so <em>Teleocrater</em> must be close to the split between them. And in several respects, Nesbitt says, &#8220;<em>Teleocrater</em> looks more like the relatives of the crocodiles than the relatives of dinosaurs.&#8221; The carnivorous animal, which was roughly the size of a small lion, walked on all fours, its forelimbs and hindlimbs are similar in proportion, and the limbs themselves are pretty short relative to the length of the body.</p>\n\n<p>Seemingly small details like these can produce ripples throughout paleontology collections, because they can help researchers properly classify fossils that had seemed to be walking contradictions. &#8220;These fossils exist in museums around the world, but until you find a keystone&#8212;something that helps you understand the full anatomy [of a species]&#8212;you won&#8217;t understand where these animals go on the tree of life,&#8221; Nesbitt says.</p>\n\n<p>After identifying <em>Teleocrater</em> as an ancestor along the avian lineage, the authors could group it with several other difficult-to-place animals, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongusuchus"><em>Dongusuchus</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylosoma"><em>Spondylosoma</em></a>, naming a new group of long-necked, carnivorous quadrupeds dubbed Aphanosauria (hidden or obscure lizards, in Greek). Aphanosaurs, they suggest, are the earliest group in the avian stem lineage to diverge from the crocodile lineage. And that suggests that these bird and dinosaur ancestors were far more diverse and widely distributed across the globe during the middle Triassic than once thought.</p>\n\n<p>The find may also alter what paleontologists hunt for in the field, as well as how they understand existing collections, says Max Langer, a paleontologist at the University of S<span>&#227;</span>o Paulo in Rio Claro, Brazil. &#8220;Now that we know the diagnostic features of this group of archosaurs, everybody working on middle Triassic rocks will be looking for something similar.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Curious fossil could rewrite early days of the dinosaurs" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Geophysicists in Iceland were studying volcanic tremors&#8212;rapidly repeating mini-earthquakes thought to come from magma moving underground&#8212;when they noticed something odd. Looking at data from Hekla Volcano, they found one tremor that arose, not from the volcano, but from a passing helicopter. As their rotor blades spin, helicopters create a series of closely spaced pressure pulses that travel through the air to the ground below. These pulses appear merged as a single tremor, which can be picked up by seismometers up to 40 kilometers away, depending on topography and wind. Seismic tremors have already been recorded for other phenomena&#8212;including floods, mud flows, and icebergs&#8212;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggx048">but this is the first time they have been detected for an aircraft</a>, the researchers report in <cite>Geophysical Journal International</cite>. To explore the signals further&#8212;and ensure helicopters aren&#8217;t mistaken for volcanoes&#8212;the team recorded tremors from a helicopter flying through a network of seven seismometers. By measuring the changing frequency of the signals as the chopper passed each one, the researchers determined the approximate location, altitude, speed, and flight direction of the craft. As most choppers don&#8217;t vary rotor speed during flight, the researchers were even able to use tremor frequencies to deduce the number of rotor blades and their revolution speed. With enough information on different helicopter specs, it might be possible to determine the model of chopper, the researchers say. And though the study looked only at helicopters, in principle the new approach could also track any rotor- or propeller-based craft, including drones.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Earthquake detectors can pick up helicopters, too" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

In a lecture hall buzzing with excitement, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and the Spanish government yesterday presented a plan to open a new lab here for the study of tissues and organs. The center, EMBL\'s first new outpost in 18 years, will host six to eight research groups; a director has yet to be named but recruitment has begun.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement is welcome news to the Spanish scientific community, which has suffered from years of budget cuts and political neglect. The agreement also strengthens Barcelona\'s profile as one of southern Europe\'s premier science hubs, adds Joan Guinovart, director of the Institute for Research in Biomedicine here. &#8220;Barcelona is already one of the hottest spots in biomedicine in Europe," he says.</p>\n\n<p>Headquartered in Heidelberg, Germany, EMBL is an international organization supported by 22 member states; it\'s not affiliated with the European Union. Over the decades, EMBL has established specialized franchises for structural biology in Hamburg, Germany, and Grenoble, France; for bioinformatics in Hinxton, U.K.; and finally, in 1999, for mouse biology in Monterotondo, Italy. The new branch, housed at the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park (PRBB), will study how cells organize and interact at the tissue level. &#8220;For a long time, tissue was not possible to study with molecular biology; now it is becoming possible, thanks to the development of new imaging techniques,&#8221; Jan Ellenberg, the head of EMBL\'s Cell Biology &amp; Biophysics Unit, said during yesterday\'s ceremony.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p class="Science">In 2006, EMBL established a joint research unit at PRBB with Barcelona\'s Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), led by current CRG director and former EMBL department head Luis Serrano. The partnership combined computational biology with genomics and proteomics to tackle complex systems biology problems. &#8220;The quality of the work that was done here was outstanding,&#8221; EMBL Director-General Iain Mattaj tells <em>Science</em>Insider. That helped convince EMBL\'s other member states to establish a fully fledged lab here, he says, as did the presence of strong universities, research institutes, and a hospital.</p>\n\n<p class="Science">EMBL will invest &#8364;16 million in the new site during the first 5 years. Spain, which contributes about &#8364;9 million annually to EMBL&#8212;8.5% of the organization\'s total budget&#8212;has put an additional &#8364;6 million on the table until 2021. The Catalan government will foot the &#8364;400,000 annual bill for rent and maintenance.</p>\n\n<p class="Science">EMBL Barcelona will provide access to state-of-the art technologies for imaging and modelling of tissues and organs, including a facility to grow organoids, mini-versions of real organs produced in vitro. Researchers will also use computers to model diseases in organs and tissues. &#8220;This opens great opportunities scientifically,&#8221; says Serrano; &#8220;for CRG, it&#8217;s a nice way to grow critical mass&#8221; in the field, he adds. &#8220;One of the biggest frontiers in biology is trying to understand organ functioning, [both] from an intellectual and medical point of view.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="EMBL opens new lab for tissue biology and disease modeling in Barcelona" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Past studies on the spread of certain lifestyle choices&#8212;from altruism to overeating&#8212;have shown that habits can travel like viruses, for good or bad. But this is the first study to rigorously analyze exercise contagion on a large scale. Using fitness tracker data posted to a social site by more than 1 million U.S. runners, researchers analyzed the distances, speeds, and total time they ran, covering 350 million kilometers over 5 years. But how to measure whether social network &#8220;friends&#8221; could influence one another? First, scientists had to tease out confounding effects like the propensity to run more on weekends. So they let the weather set up their experiment, on the understanding that nice weather is likelier to make people run. They found that as people in cities with nice weather went for especially long runs, their friends in unaffected cities would extend their own runs, increasing their running distance and time and burning more calories. That suggests that at least <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms14753">some of that extra exercise is thanks to social influence</a>, the researchers write today in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Men appeared more susceptible than&#160;women: They were strongly affected by male friends and moderately affected by&#160;female friends, whereas women were moderately affected by&#160;other women and unaffected by&#160;men. But less active runners also had an outsized influence on others. As lazier runners put in more time or distance, their friends from afar responded in kind. The&#160;researchers say their findings suggest that to encourage healthy behavior, you should target an entire social&#160;network, not just one individual. After all, what&#8217;s a race with only one person?</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Exercise is contagious, especially if you&#8217;re a man" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

The provocative finding joins a flurry of other recent, sometimes controversial work attempting to find factors that explain the apparent antiaging properties of young blood.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;These are exciting results,&#8221; says Sally Temple, scientific director of the Neural Stem Cell Institute in Rensselaer, New York, who was not involved with the work. She and others say the new finding suggests that this and other factors in young blood may have different, complementary effects on the aging brain.</p>\n\n<p>Decades ago in somewhat grisly experiments, researchers found that sewing together the circulatory systems of an old and young mouse so that they shared the same blood supply rejuvenated the old animals. In 2014, as part of renewed interest in this unusual procedure, known as parabiosis, neuroscientist Tony Wyss-Coray&#8217;s lab at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, reported that it could mimic some of the brain-boosting effects of parabiosis with&#160;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/05/young-blood-renews-old-mice">injections of young mouse plasma, the cell-free part of blood</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Identifying the responsible factors in such blood is a challenge, however. Because mice are so tiny, it&#8217;s hard to collect enough mouse plasma to do biochemical and other analyses. As an alternative, Wyss-Coray&#8217;s lab recently tested the youngest human blood available&#8212;umbilical cord blood, which is traditionally thrown away after a birth but has become increasingly prized as physicians explore its therapeutic uses.</p>\n\n<p>In the new work, Wyss-Coray&#8217;s group gave human cord blood plasma to mice of varying ages that had defective immune systems and so did not reject the foreign human tissue. Like young mouse plasma, human cord plasma injected every 4 days for 2 weeks into the circulation activated neurons in old mice&#8217;s hippocampi, where memories are made and stored. (This activation did not happen in the hippocampi of young mice treated with cord blood.) After the injections, the aging animals also navigated a maze more quickly and performed better on other tests of learning and memory, Wyss-Coray&#8217;s team&#160;<a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature22067">reports today in&#160;<cite>Nature</cite></a>.</p>\n\n<p>The team then looked for blood proteins that are abundant in human cords but decline in the general circulation with age. They ultimately homed in one called TIMP2, which was previously known to control the production of enzymes that chop up the matrix around cells and play a role in wound healing as well as the spread of cancer. (Its full name is tissue metallopeptidase inhibitor 2.) Old mice injected with mouse TIMP2 scored almost as well on memory tests as those given cord plasma, although they still didn&#8217;t match the cognitive skills of young mice, Wyss-Coray says. To help clinch its case for TIMP2, the Stanford group also showed that cord blood depleted of TIMP2 did nothing for old mice, and blocking TIMP2 in young mice impaired their memory.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers&#8217; search for antiaging factors did not point to another protein,&#160;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/05/young-blood-renews-old-mice">GDF11</a>, which some scientists have reported stimulates the growth of new blood vessels and neural stem cells in the brain. (Another claim&#8212;that GDF11 rejuvenates muscle&#8212;has been hotly contested by several labs, partly because&#160;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/10/antiaging-protein-real-deal-harvard-team-claims">their studies suggest GDF11 levels rise with age</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>But Wyss-Coray says the new study does not rule on a role for GDF11 in the brain. Harvard University neuroscientist Lee Rubin, who co-led the GDF11 brain study, says the new findings suggest &#8220;it isn&#8217;t just one thing. A lot of individual factors in blood can improve function.&#8221; Indeed, one might want to combine GDF11 and TIMP2 treatments to both generate new neurons and &#8220;get the most out of the cells that are there,&#8221; Temple suggests.</p>\n\n<p>Some experts are less impressed by the study. Parabiosis researcher Irina Conboy of the University of California, Berkeley, notes that the paper doesn&#8217;t put the modest memory and learning improvements from TIMP2 in context by comparing them to, say, putting an old mouse on an exercise wheel, which can also improve cognitive function. Her own work suggests that the apparent antiaging effects of young blood may reflect the fact that&#160;<a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/11/22/young-blood-does-not-reverse-aging-in-old-mice-uc-berkeley-study-finds/">it contains less of certain factors in old blood that her lab and others have reported contribute to aging</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Stanford has filed for patents on using TIMP2 to treat aging-associated conditions, and Alkahest, a company in San Carlos, California, that Wyss-Coray co-founded, plans to develop it. An Alkahest-sponsored trial at Stanford testing young human plasma as a treatment in 18 Alzheimer&#8217;s disease patients ended in January; results will be presented at a meeting in November, says Alkahest CEO Karoly Nikolich. (Rubin serves on Alkahest&#8217;s advisory board.) Meanwhile, some clinics are already offering young blood injections&#160;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/08/young-blood-antiaging-trial-raises-questions">to reverse aging in people</a>. But Wyss-Coray and others say such treatments are premature.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Protein isolated from human cord blood has antiaging effects on memory in mice" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Their 9-month reign of terror ended when Colonel John Patterson of the British Army shot them dead. Scientists have long debated why the lions began eating people. Now, two researchers have a new answer: They blame tooth decay for the big cats&#8217; taste for human flesh. The finding might also explain why other lions sometimes turn into human eaters.</p>\n\n<p>Lions normally consume a diverse variety of animals, including buffalo, wildebeest, giraffe, zebra, and antelope. Humans figure into their diets only rarely. In the 3 months before their deaths, however, the Tsavo human eaters <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2009/11/body-count-two-man-eating-lions">got nearly 30% of their food from people</a>, according to one recent study. Did the lions focus on humans because they were desperate? Many scientists think so. Apparently suffering from starvation&#8212;likely because drought or disease had ravaged their usual prey&#8212;they turned to another toothsome delicacy.</p>\n\n<p>But other researchers have turned up conflicting evidence. Larisa DeSantis, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, wanted a look at the lion&#8217;s preserved teeth after reading a frightful passage from Patterson&#8217;s 1907 account, <em>The Man-Eaters of Tsavo</em>: &#8220;I have a very vivid recollection of one particular night when the brutes seized a man from the railway camp and brought him close to my camp to devour. I could plainly hear them crunching the bones, and the sound &#8230; rang in my ears for days afterwards.&#8221; If the lions were that hungry, DeSantis reasoned, they must have also scavenged carcasses, a process that involves heavy bone crunching and wears down the teeth in predictable patterns.</p>\n  \n  <div class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-image">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/cc_Skull-of-first-Tsavo-man-eater2%2C-by-Bruce-Patterson-and-JP-Brown%2C-The-Field-Museum_16x9.jpg?itok=fCfEMvah" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/cc_Skull-of-first-Tsavo-man-eater2%2C-by-Bruce-Patterson-and-JP-Brown%2C-The-Field-Museum_16x9.jpg?itok=fCfEMvah 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/cc_Skull-of-first-Tsavo-man-eater2%2C-by-Bruce-Patterson-and-JP-Brown%2C-The-Field-Museum_16x9.jpg?itok=7ADY3jDR 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption">\n  \n      <p>The skull of one of the Tsavo&#160;man-eating lions</p>\n  \n</div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      Bruce Patterson and JP Brown &#169; The Field Museum  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n  \n  \n      <p>To find out, she and a colleague analyzed the lions&#8217; jaws and teeth, as well as those of a third human eater from Zambia&#8212;all stored at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois. They used a technique that can determine whether an animal is eating mostly flesh, bones, or some combination of the two. They then compared the patterns on the human eaters&#8217; teeth with those of 53 wild lion specimens from across Africa, two from India, and five captive lions. Next, the scientists examined the patterns on the teeth of cheetahs, which dine solely on flesh, and hyenas, which typically consume entire carcasses&#8212;including the bones.</p>\n\n<p>The Tsavo lions&#8217; teeth did not look like those of hyenas, DeSantis says. Instead, the wear patterns were &#8220;strikingly similar&#8221; to those of the zoo lions, which eat soft foods such as beef and horsemeat. She thinks Patterson was actually hearing the sounds of hyenas that dreadful night.</p>\n\n<p>Other research points out why the lions&#8217; dining preference shifted. One lion&#8212;the one that ate the most flesh&#8212;was known from a previous study to suffer from dental disease. A painful abscess at the root of one of his canines would have made normal hunting&#8212;grabbing and suffocating large prey&#8212;impossible, DeSantis says. His partner also had dental and jaw injuries, but these were less serious. The Zambian human eater, which did not consume bone, was also suffering from severe damage to its jaws. Together, this means that dental injuries and disease likely <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00948-5">led these lions to softer foods</a>, the researchers write today in <cite>Scientific Reports</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;[This] provides first-hand information straight from the lions&#8217; teeth that there is little evidence to support bone eating by the Tsavo lions,&#8221; says Jack Tseng, a vertebrate paleontologist at the State University of New York in&#160;Buffalo&#160;who was not involved in the study. &#8220;Any human bone consumption at the time was much more likely the work of the usual suspects&#8212;hyenas&#8212;than meat-specializing felines.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>But the scientists emphasize that bad teeth alone do not make lions into human eaters. &#8220;[They] probably targeted humans because they were easy and had soft flesh,&#8221; says DeSantis, noting that the cats didn&#8217;t consume entire carcasses. They were also doing what lions do best: hunting opportunistically from a menu that has, since the emergence of early humans, occasionally included people.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Why did these lions eat 35 men?

"You normally cannot hear me anyway," jokes the physicist at the start of a talk this past December at CERN, the particle physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, while a technician fiddles with his microphone.</p>\n\n<p>Ting may be soft-spoken, but few would call him retiring. Two decades ago, Ting persuaded funders to spend $1.5 billion to build the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS). In 2011, NASA launched the 8.5-metric-ton magnet on the penultimate space shuttle flight and attached it to the International Space Station (ISS). Now he is capturing attention again, with a hint&#8212;buried at the end of his talk&#8212;that the AMS is finally delivering on the promise of its original name, when "AM" stood for "antimatter."</p>\n\n<p>So far, the AMS has measured the masses and electric charges of some 90 billion particles that have passed through the magnet\'s maw. Nearly all of those are protons and helium nuclei, along with a smattering of electrons and nuclei of carbon, oxygen, and iron. A precious few are antiprotons and positrons: the antimatter counterparts of protons and electrons. To Ting, those antiparticles may be clues to the unseen "dark matter" that weighs down galaxies with extra gravity, although many astrophysicists regard them as the byproduct of humdrum galactic events.</p>\n\n<p>Those antiparticles are not Ting\'s big news, however. At CERN, and again in a 16 February talk at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, where he has worked since 1969, Ting says that the AMS may have trapped a bigger and weirder form of antimatter. The AMS, he says, has seen a handful of candidate particles of antihelium-3, made of two antiprotons and an antineutron. In labs on Earth, physicists have made antihelium for a few fleeting instants, but no one has ever detected it in space.</p>\n\n<p>"It was shocking," says physicist Michael Salamon, AMS project manager at the Department of Energy (DOE) in Washington, D.C., who heard about the results when Ting called him during a vacation. It\'s so unexpected that Ting says he has refrained from publishing the finding or even asking theorists what might be going on. "I want to make sure the signal is genuine," he tells <em>Science.</em> Detecting antihelium in nature could shake up cosmology. A single confirmed detection could indicate the existence of islands of antimatter that have survived since the big bang, or point to particle interactions beyond the standard model of physics. And for Ting, who turned 81 in January, it would be a vindication, a final retort to his strident critics.</p>\n\n<p>In 1976, Ting shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering a subatomic particle called the J/Psi meson. It was 1994 when he first proposed using the AMS to take the particle hunt to space. He promptly drew flak. Some contended that the project, funded by international partners and DOE, had won support through savvy political maneuvering instead of a normal scientific review, and that it wouldn\'t deliver big insights. Ting\'s results so far amount to "physics by press conference," says Greg Tarl&#233;, an astrophysicist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and a vocal critic of Ting and the AMS.</p>\n\n<p>Ting\'s marquee AMS result&#8212;that more high-energy positrons than expected are buzzing around the galaxy&#8212;has not impressed the doubters. That positron excess, which a European satellite found in the mid-2000s and the AMS confirmed, has sparked hundreds of theory papers connecting it to hypothetical dark matter particles. The mutual annihilation of those particles might create a half-and-half blend of electrons and positrons in a narrow energy range. The electrons would fade into a sea of electrons from other sources, but the rarer positrons might stand out. To Ting, the best explanation for the extra positrons is a dark matter particle with a mass of 1 teraelectronvolt&#8212;about as much energy as a flying mosquito.</p>\n\n<p>Other researchers favor more familiar astrophysical sources. The proliferation of dark matter models, including those that Ting points to, "maybe has more to do with communities and how fast they write papers than it does with science," says Tim Linden, a particle astrophysicist at The Ohio State University in Columbus. He and others note that the Milky Way is a messy laboratory, roiling with pulsars&#8212;the spinning, highly magnetic cores of collapsed stars&#8212;and supernovas, which accelerate protons to ultrahigh energies and send them slamming into cooler gas. Both phenomena could generate the antimatter that the AMS sees.</p>\n  \n  <div id="paragraph-bundle-2753" class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-markup">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="graphic entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-figure align-right"><h3 class="graphic__header">What\'s the matter?</h3>\n <div class="graphic__body">\n<p>Perched on the International Space Station, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer since 2011 has studied the charged particles that pass through its doughnut-shaped magnet.

There are few conceivable ways for conventional astrophysical processes or dark matter particles to generate that much antihelium, says Kerstin Perez, a particle astrophysicist at MIT. She is co-leading a balloon experiment that could search for antihelium when it launches over Antarctica in 2020. "If it\'s real," she says of Ting\'s claim, "it\'s something fundamentally new."</p>\n\n<p>It also would validate Ting\'s original proposal. When Ting sold NASA and DOE on the AMS, he said it might find runaway particles from oases of antimatter, helping solve a deep riddle. The big bang produced matter and antimatter in equal amounts. Soon after, they began colliding and annihilating each other in puffs of gamma rays. But somehow, matter came to dominate the observable universe. That could be because of some fundamental difference between the two&#8212;or maybe it was just a coin flip, where certain regions of space came to be ruled by one or the other. Ting\'s idea to look for those regions galvanized his critics, who considered it outlandish because clumps of antimatter coexisting with normal galaxies would produce more gamma radiation than astronomers observe. Moreover, large antiparticles could not easily survive the journey to the AMS. But if antimatter were there, the AMS would sniff it out&#8212;or so the original pitch went.</p>\n\n<p>The feeling both inside and outside of the AMS team, though, is that it\'s still far too early to rule out a more mundane explanation: a problem in the detector. As charged particles pass through the doughnut-shaped magnet, its field bends their paths into signature curves that indicate their charge and momentum. The particles arc through nine cooled-down silicon detectors that track the curves. About a billion times a year the particle turns out to be a helium nucleus, with two positive charges. But each year has also brought one event or so that for all the world looks like it is curving with charge equal to minus two, Ting says&#8212;the expected signature of antihelium. The events could just be heliums bouncing unusually off an atom inside the experiment, leading to a misidentification. But the team has used computers to model all the possible paths a particle could take in the detector. "We still do not see any possible way this could come from any background," Ting says. "Many people in the collaboration think we should publish it."</p>\n\n<p>That he hasn\'t done so yet is typical of Ting, his supporters say. "That is kind of his trademark, so to speak , to be extremely sure when something comes out," says Philip von Doetinchem of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, who is a member of the AMS team but has not worked on the antihelium problem. But critics see it differently. "He knows that he has an instrumental problem," Tarl&#233; says. To Tarl&#233;, Ting is strategically playing coy to drum up further support for the mission.</p>\n\n<p>And Ting may need it. DOE, which will review the AMS in 2019, is impatient for breakthroughs&#8212;not routine astrophysics. "Understanding the spectra of particular species of cosmic rays is good to know, but it\'s not as important, quite frankly," Salamon says. A more pressing concern is that just one of four redundant pumps that cool its silicon trackers is working at full strength.</p>\n\n<p>If the AMS can last until 2024, when the United States and other nations plan to stop funding the ISS, the magnet should be able to double its census of particles. Achieving that would not only help differentiate between exotic and mundane interpretations of its positron signals but also could give Ting more antihelium candidates. Ting won\'t say whether having 10 or more will provide the statistical power required to call this a discovery, but he says each one helps.</p>\n\n<p>Ting says he is planning to replace the broken pumps with a new system that astronauts would install during a spacewalk. A NASA spokesperson confirms that planning for the repair is underway, in case the last pump breaks. The agency has devoted $16 million to possible spacewalks between now and 2019. DOE and Ting\'s international partners have already purchased the replacement parts, he says. "There\'s no money issue," Ting says.</p>\n\n<p>If, after all these years, the AMS falls short of finding antihelium, it won\'t be for lack of trying.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Giant space magnet may have trapped antihelium, raising idea of lingering pools of antimatter in the cosmos" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Service</a><time>Apr. 19, 2017 , 1:45 PM</time></p>\n</header><p>Martin Burke is a tad envious. A chemist at the University of Illinois in Urbana, Burke has watched funding agencies back major research initiatives in other fields. Biologists pulled in billions of dollars to decipher the human genome, and physicists persuaded governments to fund the gargantuan Large Hadron Collider, which discovered the Higgs boson. Meanwhile chemists, divided among dozens of research areas, often wind up fighting for existing funds.</p>\n\n<p>Burke wants to change that. At the American Chemical Society (ACS) meeting here earlier this month, he proposed that chemists rally around an initiative to synthesize most of the hundreds of thousands of known organic natural products: the diverse small molecules made by microbes, plants, and animals. "It would be a moon mission for our field," Burke says. The effort, which would harness an automated synthesis machine he and his colleagues developed to snap together molecules from a set of premade building blocks, could cost $1 billion and take 20 years, Burke estimates. But the idea captivates at least some in the field. "Assuming it\'s a robust technology, I would have to think it would be revolutionary," says John Reed, the global head of pharma research and early development at Roche in Basel, Switzerland. "Even if it only allowed you to make half the compounds, it strikes me as worthy."</p>\n\n<p>Natural products have countless uses in modern society. They make up more than half of all medicines, as well as dyes, diagnostic probes, perfumes, sweeteners, lotions, and so on. "There\'s probably not a home on the planet that has not been impacted by natural products," Burke says.</p>\n\n<p>But discovering, isolating, and testing new natural products is slow, painstaking work. Take bryostatins, a family of 20 natural products first isolated in 1976 from spongelike marine creatures called bryozoans. Bryostatins have shown potential for treating Alzheimer\'s disease and HIV, and demand has skyrocketed. Yet chemists must mash up 14 tons of bryozoans to produce just 18 grams of bryostatin-1. Synthesizing new bryostatins is equally hard, each one requiring dozens of chemical steps.</p>\n\n<p>Burke thinks there is a better way. Two years ago, he and colleagues unveiled a machine <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6227/1190">that can link a variety of building blocks Lego-wise to create thousands of natural product compounds and their structural relatives</a>. Now he says the approach can be scaled up. Molecular biologists have already automated the synthesis of short strands of DNA, proteins, and sugar chains, revolutionizing biomedicine. Burke argues that doing the same for natural products "could have major positive implications not just for chemistry, but for society."</p>\n\n<p>Two years ago, Burke estimated that assembling 75% of natural products with his machine would take some 5000 different building blocks, compared with just four for DNA&#8212;a challenging number for chemical suppliers to make and stock. But now, Burke told the ACS meeting, the problem looks more manageable. His lab recently teamed up with that of Jeffrey Skolnick, a computational biologist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. They surveyed the literature on natural products, counted 282,487 compounds, and mapped all their structures. Skolnick\'s team then designed an algorithm to break each one into fragments, snapping only single bonds between carbon atoms&#8212;the kind of bonds Burke\'s machine can reassemble. Then the researchers asked the computer how many unique fragments it would take to reconstruct the library. It turned out that just 1400 building blocks would suffice to synthesize 75% of all natural product "chemical space," which includes related compounds not made by any organism. "This suggests it\'s a bounded, solvable problem," Burke says.</p>\n\n<p>"It\'s a profound idea," says Mukund Chorghade, president of THINQ Pharma in Mumbai, India, who believes it would be a boon for drug discovery because it could provide untold numbers of lead compounds for developing new treatments. But not everyone is sold. "Marty is a visionary," says Larry Overman, a synthetic organic chemist at the University of California, Irvine. However, he says, natural product molecules are vastly more complex in structure than biopolymers such as DNA and proteins, and whether automated synthesizers could reproduce that complexity isn\'t clear.</p>\n\n<p>An even harder problem could be securing funding for a large-scale effort to make the building blocks, assemble them into intermediate structures, and fold and tailor those to produce the final shapes. Bob Lees, head of the division at the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) in Bethesda, Maryland, that supports much of the organic chemical synthesis research in the United States, notes that in recent years NIGMS has devoted less funding to large-scale projects and more to research by single investigators. And last month, the Trump administration\'s initial budget request for 2018 proposed cutting the budget for the National Institutes of Health, the parent organization of NIGMS, by nearly 20%. Whatever its merits, Burke\'s cornucopian vision could face a steep uphill climb to become reality.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Billion-dollar project would synthesize hundreds of thousands of molecules in search of new medicines" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

A 2-year study of a population in Belgium, now entirely wiped out, has revealed that these amphibians can\'t develop immunity to the fungus, as was hoped. To make matters worse, it turns out the fungus creates a hardy spore that can survive in water for months and also stick to birds\' feet, offering a way for it to spread rapidly across the continent. Two other kinds of amphibians, both resistant to the disease, also act as carriers for the highly infectious spores.</p>\n\n<p>"This is terrible news," says geneticist Matthew Fisher of Imperial College London, who studies the fungus but was not involved in the new research. "This isn\'t a problem that\'s going to go away. It\'s a problem that\'s going to get worse."</p>\n\n<p>The pathogen, <em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em> (Bsal), is a chytrid fungus, a type that lives in damp or wet environments and typically consumes dead organic matter. Bsal infects and eats the skin of salamanders, causing lesions, apathy, loss of appetite, and eventually death. Over the past few decades, a related fungus, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5783/48"><em>B.&#160;dendrobatidis</em> (Bd), has struck hard at amphibian populations</a> around the world, particularly in the Americas, Australia, Spain, and Portugal. More than 200 species of frogs and toads are thought to have gone extinct, including many kinds of Costa Rica\'s striking stream-breeding toads.</p>\n\n<p>Bsal was identified in a nature reserve in the Netherlands in 2013 after fire salamanders started dying with ulcers and sores similar to those caused by Bd. Fire salamanders (<em>Salamandra salamandra</em>) grow up to 35 centimeters long, can live more than 40 years, and hunt insects and other small prey in forest streams. Their bright yellow spots warn predators of poison around their head and back. In the Dutch nature reserve, the population plummeted 99.9%. The fungus is thought to have arrived in Europe via salamanders or newts imported from Asia for the pet trade. Bsal has since been found in Belgium and Germany in both fire salamanders and alpine newts.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as Bsal was spotted in Belgium in April 2014, veterinarian An Martel of Ghent University&#160;in Merelbeke, Belgium, and her colleagues began visiting every month to track the population. About 90% of the fire salamanders died within 6 months, and after 2 years all were gone. The fieldwork revealed that adult animals were more likely to get infected, which makes sense because they are in closer contact with each other&#8212;through fighting for mating and breeding, for example&#8212;than are juveniles. But the death of these adults means that the population likely won\'t recover.</p>\n\n<p>There was <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature22059">no immune response detected in any of the sick animals in the lab</a>, suggesting that it will be impossible to develop a vaccine, the team reports today in <cite>Nature</cite>. "We really wanted to find solutions to mitigate disease, to save the salamanders, but everything turned out bad," Martel says. The team had also hoped that the fungus would become less virulent&#8212;as often occurs when a pathogen reaches a new host that lacks any immunity&#8212;but that hasn\'t happened: Fungal spores taken from the last fire salamanders in the Belgian forest, when dripped onto the backs of healthy salamanders in the lab, were just as lethal as those collected early in the outbreak. "When they come in contact with a single spore, they will die."</p>\n  \n  <blockquote class="pullquote">\n  \n  \n      <p>This is a very important piece of work, and it\'s terrifying. &#8230;&#160;If [this] gets loose in the United States, it\'s going to be bad.</p>\n  \n  <footer>\n  \n      Joe Mendelson, Zoo Atlanta  \n</footer>\n</blockquote>\n\n  \n  \n      <p>The paper has more bad news. Researchers knew that Bsal makes spores with a tiny tail called a flagellum, which propels them toward amphibians. If spores dry out, they die. Otherwise, they typically survive for a few days before being eaten by protozoa. But Martel\'s group discovered that Bsal makes a second type of spore that looks much hardier and is rarely eaten by protozoa. "This will make it almost impossible to eradicate the fungus from the environment," says Martel, who adds that the spores can survive in pond water for more than 2 months.</p>\n\n<p>Another experiment showed that soil remained infectious for 48 hours after it was walked on by a sick salamander. In a separate lab test, the spores adhered to goose feet, suggesting they could hitchhike long distances on birds.</p>\n\n<p>The group also showed that two species that share the same habitat as the fire salamander are likely carriers of the disease. Midwife toads (<em>Alytes obstetricans</em>) could be infected with the fungus and shed spores for a few weeks, but they didn\'t get sick. A high dose of the fungus killed alpine newts (<em>Ichthyosaura alpestris</em>), but low doses made them infectious for months without killing them. As has happened with Bd in the Americas, Bsal will lurk in these reservoirs of disease even after local populations of fire salamanders vanish. Any fire salamanders that arrive from elsewhere will likely get infected by newts or toads.&#160;&#160;</p>\n  \n  <div class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-image">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ERRYR6-hires_16x9.jpg?itok=Wllbow77" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ERRYR6-hires_16x9.jpg?itok=Wllbow77 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/ERRYR6-hires_16x9.jpg?itok=_fM0PH9l 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption">\n  \n      <p>Midwife toads, known for carrying their eggs on their back, can spread the fungus while infected, but they don\'t get sick.</p>\n  \n</div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      Tierfotoagentur/Alamy Stock Photo  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n  \n  \n      <p>According to results from&#160;<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/630">previous infection trials</a>, most salamander species in Europe are likely just as vulnerable to Bsal. The fire salamander has a range that extends across Europe, and the fear is that the fungus will reach endangered salamanders. With small populations, these species could more easily be driven extinct, Fisher says. "The assumption is that they are all at risk," he says, and the findings in the new paper "have really upped their risk status." Martel and European colleagues recently started monitoring for Bsal in seven countries.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible to cure amphibians in the lab. For animals that can take the heat, like fire salamanders, 10 days at 25&#176;C will kill the fungus. Other species can be cured with a combination of two drugs. But there is no practical solution for animals in the wild, especially when their habitat is contaminated with fungal spores.</p>\n\n<p>Herpetologist Jaime Bosch of the National Museum of Natural History in Madrid had a rare success in eliminating a chytrid fungus from the wild. A few years ago, he and colleagues got <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/11/biologists-wipe-out-toad-killing-fungus-spanish-island">rid of Bd on the Spanish island of Mallorca</a> by temporarily removing some 2000 tadpoles of the Mallorcan midwife toad (<em>Alytes muletensis</em>) and disinfecting their ponds with powerful chemicals. But this success would be hard to replicate in less isolated locations, he says. "Right now, we are very far away from having any solution." The only hope in the meantime, Bosch and others say, is to slow the spread of the disease by ending the importation of amphibians.</p>\n\n<p>The United States, a hot spot of amphibian diversity, has already taken steps in that direction. Last year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="https://www.fws.gov/injuriouswildlife/salamanders.html">banned the import of 201 species of salamanders</a> on the grounds that they might introduce the fungus. Joe Mendelson, a herpetologist at Zoo Atlanta, says the new research suggests the list should be expanded to include other carriers such as the toad and newt studied in the new paper. "This is a very important piece of work, and it\'s terrifying," he says. "If Bsal gets loose in the United States," he says, "it\'s going to be bad."</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="A deadly salamander disease just got a lot scarier " class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

For most of his career, the microbiologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, paid the discipline little attention, but he did notice the <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf">field-shaking 2009 report</a> from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), which found that many forensic techniques, from fingerprint comparisons to bloodstain pattern analysis, lacked a firm scientific footing. &#8220;I remember reading [NAS] about this and I said, &#8216;Oh my God, I thought fingerprints had been validated,&#8217;&#8221; he remembers.</p>\n\n<p>He would soon play a direct role in the field&#8217;s reform, as one of a handful of basic researchers invited to serve alongside lawyers, judges, and forensic practitioners on a panel, created by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), in partnership with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to advise DOJ on how to respond to the NAS report&#8217;s concerns. Since its founding in 2013, the panel has published 43 documents and made 20 official recommendations to the attorney general, including a call for the universal accreditation of forensic practitioners and for the phasing out of the meaningless phrase &#8220;reasonable scientific certainty&#8221; that is common in courtrooms.</p>\n\n<p>Last week, Casadevall and five other scientific members of the commission <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3549346/Scientists-on-national-commission-urge-panel-be.pdf">wrote a letter</a> to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and acting National Institute of Standards and Technology Director Kent Rochford asking them to renew the group&#8217;s charter, set to run out 23 April. Instead, Sessions and DOJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/956146/download">announced on Monday</a> that the charter would be allowed to expire, and he requested proposals for a new advisory committee or an office within DOJ that would advance forensic science&#8212;a move many fear will exclude mainstream scientific views from future policy decisions.&#160;</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>Casadevall spoke to <cite>Science</cite>Insider about the commission&#8217;s value, its limitations, and what he expects to be its legacy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What was the logic behind this panel?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A: </strong>If you think about it, the techniques that formed forensic science were created to try to do criminal investigations. &#8230;&#160;Their ancestry is out of the mainstream of science, in the sense that they were developed for the purpose of trying to help solve crimes, and consequently, many of these techniques never got validated.&#160;&#8230; The big innovation of the commission was that you had mainstream scientists sitting at the table with judges, prosecutors, and forensic [practitioners]. &#8230; We [scientists] were there because science has traditions and approaches that transcend disciplines. Even though our domains are very different, our approaches to inquiry, our approaches to error, are pretty similar.</p>\n\n<p>The first five meetings of the commission, very little got done because we were trying even to learn to talk to one another. We come from completely different worlds. Law works as a dichotomy&#8212;you&#8217;re guilty or not guilty. In science, all knowledge is provisional. I assume that what we&#8217;re doing in my lab today is going to be overturned in the future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What do you see as the key products of the commission?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A: </strong>I think the document that was voted on in September [2016] stating that new techniques of forensic science need to be independently validated is a really important line in the sand. &#8230; Today, if you develop a new technique to characterize white powders, and you start a company, you can actually sell this to police departments without necessarily going through any [validation] mechanism &#8230; and then use it in court, in a situation in which the lawyers don&#8217;t know any of the science. So who is going to challenge any of this?</p>\n\n<p>The recommendation was that it should go to an independent entity that is not part of the justice department. &#8230;&#160;And to me, that is probably the single most important output of the committee. That at least is on record.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What about all the existing techniques that are still used in court and haven&#8217;t been validated, such as bite mark evidence?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Of course, we wanted [the document] to be bigger. We wanted it to be retrospective. But we had to compromise to get the votes. &#8230; We were a deliberative body and we need to get a product out, and if you dig your heels and say all of it needs to be independently validated, you couldn&#8217;t even get that statement.</p>\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t put the genie back in the bottle. The questions are out there. The Innocence Project, for example, is training lawyers on what questions to ask [about certain] techniques. We have an adversarial system. Inevitably, the pressure is going to come in, even from the prosecutors who say, &#8220;Hey guys, we&#8217;ve got to fix these techniques, because every time I present this, they hit me with these questions.&#8221; &#8230; There is a greater awareness now that if you&#8217;re going to introduce any of these things into court, you may be asked, &#8220;Where is your error rate? How do you really know what a match is? What does that mean?&#8221; I&#160;tend to look at this as progress.</p>\n\n<p>On Monday [at the commission&#8217;s final meeting], there were two documents that were voted down. &#8230; One of the documents was just to recommend that when somebody testified, if you asked them about an error rate, they should be able to tell you that they had it, or that they didn&#8217;t know. I think that if I stopped somebody on the street and I asked them, most people would agree that this is a reasonable thing. But some of the people &#8230;&#160;felt that this recommendation would be used by defense lawyers to question a lot of [forensic] practitioners. If we had continued to meet, those documents would have gone back to committee &#8230; and they would have figured out a way to work around &#8230; and they may have passed in the summer meeting or the fall meeting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Did you expect the commission&#8217;s charter to be renewed?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A: </strong>The truth of the matter is we did not know. We knew it was a congressional charter and Congress had basically appropriated money to run the commission a certain number of cycles. We thought that with the new administration, there was a high probability that perhaps it didn&#8217;t get renewed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Why wouldn&#8217;t DOJ support continuing the commission?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Sessions&#8217;s statement doesn&#8217;t say anything bad about science. They basically say that we&#8217;re going to take this and we&#8217;re going to put it back in the Department of Justice, create a new office of forensic science. On the surface, that sounds good. You could imagine that they could create an office with a lot of scientific input. &#8230; The problem of forensic science is that it grew out of an arm of the judiciary, and by putting it back, you basically don&#8217;t deal with the questions that are being asked from mainstream science. &#8230; The commission was the only mechanism that existed where you had working scientists talking to people who actually do forensic science to generate data that is consumed by the legal system. And we were a minority.</p>\n\n<p>I served on the anthrax investigation&#8212;the National Academy of Sciences study that was done on [<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2008/09/fbi-request-scientific-review-its-anthrax-investigation">the 2001 anthrax mailings</a>]&#8212;so I can tell you that the culture of criminal justice feels very uncomfortable when you question their techniques. And that is natural. These people are trying to reduce crime by putting people away. And here you have a situation in which techniques that they have used for many, many years come into question, and I think there is natural instinct to say, &#8220;Oh, God.&#8221; Some of that may have been there. But there are also a lot of people who recognize that these problems aren&#8217;t going away. And the way to deal with this is to do the science.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Q&amp;A: The U.S. Department of Justice scrapped independent forensics panel, but the scientific questions &#8216;are not going away&#8217;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Writing a good proposal can take months, and the chances of getting funded are often slim. Funding agencies, meanwhile, spend more and more time and money reviewing growing stacks of applications.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why two researchers are proposing a radically different system that would do away with applications and reviews; instead scientists would just give each other money. &#8220;Self-organized fund allocation&#8221; (SOFA), as it&#8217;s called, was developed by computer scientist Johan Bollen at Indiana University in Bloomington. When he first published about the idea in 2014, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6171/598">many people were skeptical</a>. But interest appears to be growing, and thanks to the work of an enthusiastic advocate, ecologist Marten Scheffer of Wageningen University in the Netherlands, the Dutch parliament adopted a motion last year asking the country&#8217;s main funding agency, the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), to set up a SOFA pilot project.</p>\n\n<p>Competition for funding has become too intense, especially for young scientists, Scheffer and Bollen say, and the current peer-review system is inefficient. It&#8217;s also unfair, they argue, because a few scientists get lots of grants&#8212;Scheffer is one of them&#8212;whereas many others get few or nothing. But when Scheffer explained his idea at an NWO workshop about &#8220;application pressure&#8221; here last week, the agency didn&#8217;t appear sold yet.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>The duo says the numbers speak for themselves. At the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the overall success rate for grants applications has dropped from 30% in 2003 to 19.1% in 2016. In the latest round of European Research Council Starting Grants, the rate was a paltry 11.3%. At NWO, the success rate for grants for young scientists has dropped to 14%. A 2013 study estimated that writing and reviewing applications for &#8364;40 million worth of these grants costs &#8364;9.5 million annually.</p>\n\n<p>In Bollen&#8217;s system, scientists no longer have to apply; instead, they all receive an equal share of the funding budget annually&#8212;some &#8364;30,000 in the Netherlands, and $100,000 in the United States&#8212;but they have to donate a fixed percentage to other scientists whose work they respect and find important. &#8220;Our system is not based on committees&#8217; judgments, but on the wisdom of the crowd,&#8221; Scheffer told the meeting.</p>\n\n<p>Bollen and his colleagues have tested their idea in computer simulations. If scientists allocated 50% of their money to colleagues they cite in their papers, research funds would roughly be distributed the way funding agencies currently do, <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-016-2110-3">they showed in a paper last year</a>&#8212;but at much lower overhead costs.</p>\n\n<p>Not everybody is convinced. At the meeting, some worried that scientists might give money mostly to their friends. Scheffer said an algorithm would prevent that, for instance by banning donations to people you have published with, but he acknowledged it would be a challenge in small research communities. SOFA might also result in a mismatch between what scientists need and what their colleagues donate, and a competition for donations could lead to a time-consuming and costly circus, comparable to an election campaign.</p>\n\n<p>The way to find out, Scheffer and Bollen say, is a real-world test, and they say the Netherlands, a small country with short lines of communication between scientists, politicians, and funding agencies, is a good place for one. Last year, Scheffer convinced Eppo Bruins, a member of the Dutch House of Representatives, to submit a motion calling for a pilot program at NWO, which the parliament approved in June 2016. The money could be taken from a &#8364;150 million NWO pot currently distributed among consortia of innovative Dutch scientists, Bruins suggested.</p>\n\n<p>But NWO is not obliged to carry out the proposal, and so far has shown little enthusiasm. &#8220;NWO is willing to explore together with scientists and other stakeholders how to improve allocation rates, but is still considering practicality and support&#8221; for SOFA, a spokesperson tells <cite>Science</cite>Insider. At last week&#8217;s meeting, NWO President Stan Gielen said the funds Bruins has in mind are distributed by NWO but are earmarked by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, which would have to give permission. Gielen added that any experiment should not come at the expense of existing funding.</p>\n\n<p>Scheffer says he&#8217;s not giving up. It&#8217;s not a risky experiment, he says: &#8220;The money would not be wasted, after all, but just be given to other scientists.&#8221; But he says he understands why NWO is not thrilled: If applied universally, the novel system would make the agency redundant. Perhaps it&#8217;s telling, Scheffer says, that he has not been invited to an <a href="http://www.nwo.nl/en/policies/nwo+conferences+2017/international+conference">international conference on applications and peer review that NWO is organizing in June</a>.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="With this new system, scientists never have to write a grant application again" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

It&#8217;s time to place your bets, for NASA&#8217;s Cassini spacecraft, which has spent the past 13 years exploring the planet and its moons, is finally swooping close enough to take a look.</p>\n\n<p>On 26 April, it will thread the gap between the gas giant and its rings in the first of 22 week-long orbits that will culminate in September with a fiery and fatal plunge into the atmosphere. The Grand Finale, as NASA is calling the forays, should help answer questions about Saturn&#8217;s atmosphere and interior. But most of all, it should end a debate about the mass of the water ice rings, which is a big clue to their age&#8212;whether they are 4.5 billion years old, nearly as old as the planet, or much younger. The Cassini team has a betting pool on the mass: $5 a wager, due before the first orbit.</p>\n\n<p>The route will be dangerous. The gap contains ice particles finer than soot, which ought not to harm the spacecraft. But if the models are wrong, and Cassini collides at 122,000 kilometers per hour with something even as large as a BB, the mission will end early. &#8220;This is something we wouldn&#8217;t want to try at another time,&#8221; says Earl Maize, the Cassini program manager at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) in Pasadena, California. To be cautious, on its first pass, Cassini will hide behind its large antenna, using it as a shield to protect its instruments.</p>\n\n<p>As the spacecraft plunges toward the rings in subsequent orbits, a radio telescope in Argentina will be listening for tiny Doppler shifts in Cassini&#8217;s signal. Those will allow the team to tease out the gravitational pull of the rings from that of Saturn&#8212;a distinction that could not be made when Cassini was orbiting outside the rings, says Luciano Iess, a planetary scientist at the Sapienza University of Rome. The measurement could provide a verdict on the rings&#8217; mass&#8212;and their age.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, many scientists have assumed that the rings are nearly as old as Saturn itself&#8212;massive structures formed of icy planetary building blocks. Early on, Cassini showed the B ring, one of four main rings, to be bright and nearly opaque, bolstering the view that the ice particles are dense and that the rings have a total mass greater than Saturn&#8217;s 400-kilometer-wide moon, Mimas.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="figure__minimal entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-related-articles align-right"><article class="media media--var media--priority-2"><div class="media__icon">\n        \n  \n      <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/food-microbes-abundant-enceladus"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.sciencemag.org//www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/grid_thumb_-_290x163__16_9_/public/4852_PIA11688_1280x720.jpg?itok=lNtM6FkI" alt="An image of Enceladus plumes"></a>  \n      </div>\n    \n    <div class="media__body">\n              <h3 class="overline"></h3>\n      \n\n      \n      <h2 class="media__headline">\n        <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/food-microbes-abundant-enceladus">Food for microbes abundant on Enceladus</a>\n      </h2>\n          </div>\n  </article></figure><p>But an alternate view is gaining credence: that the rings are more delicate structures formed within the last 100 million years from the smashed ice of a lost moon. An age of 4.5 billion years is hard to reconcile with their pristine color, because a steady stream of sooty micrometeoroids from interplanetary space should have darkened them by now, like drops of black ink spreading in a pool of white paint. Moreover, the spacing between rippling, spiral waves within the rings, created by gravitational resonances with Saturn&#8217;s moons, can offer another clue to mass, and judging from a handful of wavelets recently spied within the bright B ring, it is low. Iess believes the total mass of the rings to be just 20% to 80% of Mimas.</p>\n\n<p>Cassini may reveal another clue when its close passage gives it the best view yet of the interior C and D rings. Amid the C ring&#8217;s icy particles, there are hints of larger chunks of rubble, says Jeff Cuzzi, a ring specialist at NASA&#8217;s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, who believes the rings are young. &#8220;This could even be the core of the object that formed the rings.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>By catching stray ring particles, the spacecraft could also learn more about the makeup of the rings themselves, which are at least 90% water ice. Their distinctive shade of taupe could come from reddish iron oxide or carotene, the orange of carrots.</p>\n\n<p>As the spacecraft&#8217;s orbits take it ever closer to Saturn itself, it will shift its attention from the rings to the planet&#8217;s roiling ammonia clouds. Its cameras should see the structure of storms, and shadows could reveal the architecture of sharp lines of clouds that may extend for several thousand kilometers. Close-up measurements of the planet&#8217;s magnetic field could finally reveal the length of a day on Saturn. With no solid surface to define a day, scientists hope to use periodic patterns in Saturn&#8217;s magnetic field to get at the rotation of its interior.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in the last five orbits, &#8220;we&#8217;re going to dip our toe into the atmosphere of Saturn,&#8221; says Linda Spilker, the Cassini project scientist at JPL. It will be the first time humanity has sampled the atmosphere of a gas giant since the Galileo spacecraft dropped a probe into Jupiter in 1995. If they get lucky, researchers could estimate the abundances of helium and hydrogen in Saturn&#8217;s outer layers, which, in turn, could help illuminate its interior structure and how gas giants form.</p>\n\n<p>On its final dive into Saturn, on 15 September, Cassini will point its antenna to Earth, but the spacecraft should go silent quickly, vaporizing within 3 minutes. Planners deemed it necessary to destroy Cassini rather than leave it wandering near Saturn because it may carry stowaway terrestrial microbes that could contaminate two Saturn moons, Titan and Enceladus, that have potentially habitable conditions.</p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s much to do before then. Cuzzi, though he favors youthful, low-mass rings, hasn&#8217;t gotten his bet into the pool yet. He&#8217;s waiting until the last minute. &#8220;I know time is getting short.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="In mission\'s last hurrah, Cassini aims to solve riddle of Saturn\'s rings" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

The new weather forecast has rolled in, and the climate scientists, even though it&#8217;s not typically their business, dig out their phones to look: snow tomorrow&#8212;hardly unusual for early February in Princeton, New Jersey. But the weather models have the storm breaking severe, dumping a foot or more. A snow day seems likely.</p>\n\n<p>Across the table at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), Shian-Jiann &#8220;S. J.&#8221; Lin is not convinced. He is the master of 20,000 lines of computer code that divide the atmosphere into boxes and, with canny accuracy, solve the equations that describe how air swirls around the globe. For decades, Lin&#8217;s program has powered the long-term simulations of many climate models, including GFDL&#8217;s&#8212;one of the crown jewels of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Now, Lin&#8217;s domain is expanding to a different side of NOAA: the short-term weather forecasts of the National Weather Service (NWS). By 2018, Lin&#8217;s program will be powering a unified system for both climate and weather forecasting, one that could predict conditions tomorrow, or a century from now&#8212;and do it faster and better than current models. His work will soon be guiding mayors planning not just for snow plows, but also rising seas.</p>\n\n<p>But Lin has started early. His small team is already running a prototype forecast on their supercomputer. And in his typically confident and brash style, he offers a minority report about the next day&#8217;s storm.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;If our forecast is correct, it&#8217;s only 3 to 6 inches,&#8221; Lin announces. His peers at the&#160;table seem skeptical. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a mess,&#8221; one warns. But Lin doesn&#8217;t budge. He rarely needs to. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see what we get tomorrow,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You want to bet?&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Much is riding on Lin. Recently, NWS has suffered some prominent embarrassments, such as in 2012, when it predicted Hurricane Sandy would sputter out over the ocean while a leading European center accurately forecast the direct hit on New York City. Fed up with the country&#8217;s second-place status, Congress in 2013 poured $48 million into NWS weather modeling. The message for NOAA was clear: Get America on top.</p>\n\n<p>This drive has opened up an opportunity. For a long time, meteorologists and climate scientists operated in separate domains. Meteorologists focused on speed: ingesting as many data as possible from satellites, balloons, and buoys and quickly spinning it into a forecast. Climate scientists focused on the fussy physics of their models to produce plausible simulations over decades. But now, the two groups are discovering common ground, in &#8220;subseasonal to seasonal&#8221; predictions&#8212;from a month to 2 years out. In order to push forecasts beyond 10 days or so, meteorologists need the superior physics of the climate models. Meanwhile, climate scientists want to know how weather phenomena that happen on monthly or annual timescales, like El Ni&#241;o, influence the global climate. &#8220;The two cultures are speaking each other&#8217;s language, and realizing they&#8217;re going to live and die together,&#8221; says John Michalakes, an atmospheric scientist at the Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, California.</p>\n\n<p>There could be another benefit to blurring the lines between weather and climate, one that climate scientists are loath to talk about explicitly. Although studies of human-driven climate change have faced scrutiny and scorn from conservative politicians in the United States, weather research remains solidly bipartisan, says David Titley, director of the Center for Solutions to Weather and Climate Risk at Pennsylvania State University in State College. Just this month, for example, Congress passed a weather forecasting bill that dedicates $26.5 million of NOAA&#8217;s budget to improving its seasonal predictions, and climate change doubters were among the supporters. &#8220;If I were running the world, I would keep that divide vague,&#8221; Titley says.</p>\n\n<p>In his modeling, Lin never made the distinction. &#8220;From the beginning we talked about how there is no difference between weather and climate,&#8221; says Ricky Rood, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Lin&#8217;s longtime collaborator. But others haven&#8217;t wanted to hear that message&#8212;and especially not from Lin, who is as feisty and fractious as a government employee can get. &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing to me,&#8221; says Rood, &#8220;that S. J. could evolve to be a source of unification.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Storms have roiled around Lin his whole life. Typhoons are regular events in Taipei, where he grew up, and he was always fascinated by their power. &#8220;I have hurricanes in my blood,&#8221; he says. Born in 1958 to parents who ran a small construction company, he was the first in his family to go to college. As a student at National Taiwan University, he studied microprocessor architectures, along with meteorology and fluid dynamics. He became fascinated with the challenge of rendering the continuous currents of the atmosphere in the discontinuous, 0-or-1 world of computer code.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, Taiwan was a dictatorship, and Lin joined student groups opposed to the regime. After college, he faced several years of mandatory military service. He aced his entry test and assumed he would land a cushy engineering job in Taipei. Instead, he was shipped to the Matsu Islands, 16 kilometers from the Chinese mainland. He was hardly a model soldier. He hated having to recite party doctrine during assemblies. &#8220;You had to pretend, and say something not in your heart,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n<p>Taiwan didn&#8217;t seem to have a place for him, so in 1983 he enrolled in the aerospace engineering department at the University of Oklahoma, one of the only schools he could afford. He wanted to be a rocket scientist. But it was a tough transition. He cared more about learning computer languages than English, and felt isolated. His accent is a barrier, but not the only one. &#8220;Some folks tend to have a difficult time following S. J.,&#8221; says Bill Putman, a meteorologist at NASA&#8217;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and another longtime collaborator. &#8220;But it&#8217;s not necessarily a language barrier. It&#8217;s more a knowledge barrier.&#8221; Seeing his talent for computational fluid dynamics, his adviser suggested Lin switch to Princeton University, which with its partnership with GFDL is a hotbed for atmospheric modeling.</p>\n\n<p>He learned how GFDL scientists divided the air into a 3D grid that spanned the globe and stretched from the surface to the stratosphere, following lines of latitude and longitude. Along points on the grid, they would set initial conditions&#8212;the weather or climate for a given moment in time. Then, point by point, the computer would solve equations describing changes in wind, air pressure, temperature, and humidity for successive steps in time. Computers were room-sized mainframes at the time, and the model grids were huge, with a mesh size of 500 kilometers. The models could recreate only the largest atmospheric features, like jet streams and the Hadley cell, the belt that circulates warm air from the equator to the subtropics.</p>\n\n<p>After graduate school, Lin decided to stay in the United States. &#8220;I&#8217;m now more American than I am Taiwanese,&#8221; he says. He drinks whisky, but infuses it with ginseng. He returned to the University of Oklahoma as a postdoc to work on modeling tornadoes. But computers couldn&#8217;t yet model events that unfold at such small scales. The failure was humbling, and Lin says it provided a mantra: &#8220;Choose the right level of complexity for the particular problem, at the time that you have the resources to do it.&#8221; Lin soon found the right problem at NASA.&#160;</p>\n  \n  <div class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-image">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ma_0414_NF_SJLin_tornado_NEW_700px.jpg?itok=Ee9FTpFx" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ma_0414_NF_SJLin_tornado_NEW_700px.jpg?itok=Ee9FTpFx 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/ma_0414_NF_SJLin_tornado_NEW_700px.jpg?itok=HpHgxBnv 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption">\n  \n      <p>At high resolution, Lin&#8217;s model can simulate tornadoes, such as the 2013 twister in Moore, Oklahoma, that killed 24 people.</p>\n  \n</div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      VINCENT DELIGNY/AFP/GETTY IMAGES  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n  \n  \n      <p>In the late 1980s, Rood was working on the problem of the Antarctic ozone hole at Goddard. NASA was flying research planes into the hole to measure the chemicals that might be destroying it. These flights revealed a drop in several short-lived reactive nitrogen oxides, which allowed chlorine from humanmade chemicals to linger,&#160;priming further reactions that broke down the ozone. But Rood&#8217;s atmospheric models couldn&#8217;t simulate the flows and reactions. No matter what he did, the nitrogen reactants remained steady.</p>\n\n<p>How could that happen? At the time, an elegant mathematical solution had overtaken global modeling, called the spectral method. Rather than solving at points on a latitude-longitude grid, scientists realized that fluid flow in the atmosphere could be represented as the sum of a series of hundreds of sinusoidal, crisscrossing waves. The code ran faster, and the results could be transformed back onto a regular grid. The spectral method still powers most global weather forecasts today, including at NWS. But the speed comes with a cost: When the waves are projected back into physical space, mass can gradually grow unbalanced. For weather models, which only run for days into the future, this is not a big deal. But for models of atmospheric chemistry and climate, which run for much longer periods, these distortions were a critical flaw.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately for Rood, a young Taiwanese scientist had written to him, lured by his publications. When Lin joined NASA in 1992 as a contractor, the two set out to build a model that, above all else, preserved mass. This first meant jettisoning the spectral method. It also meant upgrading from finite-difference modeling, which solves for points on a grid, to a finite-volume model, which solves for conditions averaged across each cell, or box, and is ideally suited for conserving mass because the calculations pass fluxes, or volumes, of material from one box to the next. Others had considered such a solution, but thought it too complex or computationally expensive.</p>\n\n<p>But Lin was a master of computational efficiency. Over a furious few years in the mid-1990s, he and Rood expanded their model beyond chemical transport&#8212;for which it remains the standard&#8212;to a fullfledged dynamical core fast enough to be used for climate models. Put a mote of dust in the air, says Paul Ginoux, an aerosol modeler at GFDL, who also worked with Lin at Goddard, &#8220;and this code will transport it at the right place, at the right moment. And that&#8217;s beautiful.&#8221; The name of the code was far more mundane. They called it &#8220;FV,&#8221; for finite-volume, and later FV3.</p>\n\n<p>Their work soon drew the attention of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, one of the country&#8217;s leading institutes for weather and climate science, which incorporated FV into its influential climate model. NASA&#8217;s climate laboratory in New York City adopted it as well. And in 2003, GFDL lured Lin away to upgrade FV and fold it into its global simulation. The results of these models, some of the top U.S. contributions to the United Nations panel on climate change, have informed much of what the public hears about global warming. And they&#8217;ve all had Lin&#8217;s innovations at their heart.</p>\n\n<p>There\'s a term of art at NOAA for the reactive way Congress finances weather research: &#8220;budgeting by disaster.&#8221; It&#8217;s rarely pretty, and it&#8217;s why the coming merger in atmospheric modeling will, at its root, be thanks to the calamities of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>In 2005, after NWS failed to forecast Katrina&#8217;s direct hit on New Orleans, Louisiana, until 2 days out, Congress set aside money to improve predictions of Atlantic hurricanes. As it happened, it was around this time that Lin walked into the office of his boss at GFDL, Isaac Held, and declared: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to revolutionize weather prediction.&#8221; Computers were now capable of processing boxes small enough to render hurricanes. More important, Lin had developed a key bit of physics needed for FV3 to forecast realistic hurricanes. Many global forecasting models operate using an assumption called the hydrostatic principle&#8212;where the gravity of the air in any box is exactly balanced by the upward force of the air pressure in the box below it. This works for coarse models, which cannot directly simulate the fine upward and downward flows in the real atmosphere. But recreating weather events like hurricanes and thunderstorms, where updrafts are important, requires breaking this hydrostatic principle. After a decade of mulling, Lin finally had an efficient way of incorporating nonhydrostatic flows into his code.</p>\n\n<p>He needed to test it. Frank Marks, who leads hurricane research at NOAA&#8217;s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami, Florida, was overseeing improvements for the regional hurricane model for the Atlantic basin. With a smaller area to model, Marks can afford to have fine-scale boxes. Lin convinced him to use Katrina dollars to buy extra supercomputer time. Run FV3 at a 1-kilometer resolution, Lin promised, and the finest details of cyclones would arise. Sure enough, the violent walls of a hurricane&#8217;s eye opened in his code.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="graphic entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-figure"><h3 class="graphic__header">Zooming in on storms</h3>\n  <div class="graphic__body">\n<p>The FV3 model divides the atmosphere into boxes and simulates conditions in each one.

BICKEL/<i>SCIENCE</i>; XI CHEN (PRINCETON UNIVERSITY); NASA&#8217;S GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure></figure><p>In 2014, when NOAA announced a competition to choose the &#8220;core&#8221; of the agency&#8217;s next-generation weather forecast system, Lin was ready.</p>\n\n<p>Five models were entered, including FV3. And by the summer of 2015, FV3 was one of two frontrunners, along with the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS), the globalized version of a long-standing system produced by NCAR and used by many researchers. They would be judged on their speed and accuracy in mimicking the atmosphere&#8217;s flows.</p>\n\n<p>For 6 months, Lin&#8217;s placid office turned frenetic, as his team worked nights and weekends to embed FV3 within the weather service&#8217;s system. &#8220;There was never a time where I thought we were losing the battle on scientific ground,&#8221; Lin says. One advantage of his model was efficiency. It is Lin&#8217;s obsession&#8212;and not just at work: When Hurricane Sandy knocked out power at Lin&#8217;s modest home, he refused to use a normal generator, and instead rigged his Prius up to his home wiring. Its battery, he explained, would make certain any extra electricity the car&#8217;s generator churned out wouldn&#8217;t go to waste.</p>\n\n<p>So that FV3 could make efficient use of limited computing power, Lin and his team had written the code to work in parallel. This is hard for global models, where the weather in one box can influence another box a hemisphere away. But this interconnectedness isn&#8217;t as big a problem in the vertical dimension, so Lin enabled FV3&#8217;s layers to be detached from each other and be processed in parallel. He won additional efficiencies by changing the shape of the grid. Climate models are plagued by the so-called pole problem, the result of the strangely squished and stretched boxes near the poles. So Lin and Putman, his former&#160;NASA colleague, abandoned the latitudelongitude system in favor of a cubed sphere. Picture a six-sided die inflated like a balloon. There were no more poles to handle, just six square panels, with tricky interactions at the seams.</p>\n\n<p>The net result: compared with MPAS, FV3 took a third as many computer processors to run at operational standards. It also scaled more efficiently to a vast number of processors, and it could zoom in to model one part of the globe at high resolution without skewing its performance in coarser regions. It was a slaughter. NCAR withdrew its model before NOAA anointed FV3 as the winner, in July 2016. &#8220;There was just never any conclusive evidence that MPAS had an advantage that was worth the cost,&#8221; says Michalakes, who led the computing comparisons.</p>\n\n<p>During the competition, Lin had complained that NOAA was biased in favor of MPAS; now, he crows about his victory. &#8220;Most people in that discipline paid no respect to what we had been doing,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They found out the hard way.&#8221; With NCAR toppled, Lin now faces far bigger rivals: the United Kingdom&#8217;s Met Office, which since the early 1990s has been the only center to have merged its weather and climate forecasts, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts, which has long run the top-rated weather model.</p>\n\n<p>This time around, he&#8217;ll need help.</p>\n\n<p>European modelers start with the same set of balloon, satellite, and ground measurements as everyone else. But they cleverly inject randomness into these initial conditions, then do multiple runs to come up with a &#8220;consensus&#8221; forecast. Getting the United States up to those standards will require winning over U.S. researchers to provide innovative techniques that Lin and his colleagues can adapt for their model.</p>\n\n<p>Yet there&#8217;s a risk that academic weather scientists will avoid using FV3 and instead stick with MPAS, more comfortable with its origins and documentation, says Cliff Mass, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. Lin&#8217;s reluctance to break down his code in the past has heightened concerns. &#8220;Lin is a brilliant modeler,&#8221; Mass says. &#8220;He&#8217;s not big on community support.&#8221; But Putman believes Lin will embrace true improvements. &#8220;If he sees something that will push this code beyond where it is now, I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s willing to adapt.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>At a workshop next week, NWS will lay out its aggressive timetable for turning on FV3. By this May, FV3 ought to be fully wired into the service&#8217;s data assimilation. And by the first half of 2018, if all goes well, NOAA will flip the switch, making it the standard forecast that feeds into all of our phones.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Lin&#8217;s team continues to tinker with FV3. They&#8217;re honing a more powerful zooming technique: allowing the grid to create nests of high-resolution boxes, 2 to 3 kilometers a side, over regions of interest. This could allow high-resolution hurricane forecasts to be run at the same time as global predictions, with no need to wait for the global run to finish. And it could capture tornado outbreaks and severe storms, weather that has been too finegrained for existing global models. &#8220;We&#8217;re kind of ambitious,&#8221; Lin says. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to cover everything.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>On a screen at GFDL, Lucas Harris, Lin&#8217;s deputy, zooms in on Oklahoma, where a nested FV3 grid is recreating the events of May 2013. It was that month that a severe twister plowed through Moore, Oklahoma, killing 24. As the model runs, scattered storms organize into a line of squalls. Then anvil clouds form&#8212;the thunderstorm cells from which tornadoes would touch down on Moore. Next, Harris changes the place and time, to the eastern United States in June 2012, when a bow of thunderstorms&#8212;a so-called derecho&#8212;caught forecasters off guard and in some areas knocked out power for a week. The model sees traces of the storm nearly 3 days in advance. &#8220;Previously,&#8221; Harris says, &#8220;it was believed there was only 12 hours of predictability to this event.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>So far these results have stayed in the lab, but Lin is doing his best to spread the gospel. For the 2017 hurricane season, his prototype will run alongside existing regional hurricane models. And next month, Lin will return to Oklahoma for the &#8220;Spring Experiment,&#8221; a research jamboree of severe storm scientists, to test how the zooming technique could help local forecasters.</p>\n\n<p>All this collaboration, this dependence on outside contributions, makes Lin nervous. His model is moving out of the lab into the messy real world. Will it become the bedrock of all weather and climate prediction, from tornadoes next week to temperature rises next decade? &#8220;I&#8217;m cautiously optimistic, but not overly optimistic,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n<p>A good omen comes the next morning. Snow blankets Princeton&#8212;beautiful, but also manageable. Nearly 6 inches fell, not a foot or more. GFDL could have stayed open. Over the ether, Lin can&#8217;t resist a final comment. &#8220;The snow,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;is not as bad as forecasted.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Take that, Europe.

Physicists propose test of controversial idea</h1>  <p class="byline byline--article">\n  By <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/author/adrian-cho">Adrian Cho</a><time>Apr. 14, 2017 , 3:00 AM</time></p>\n</header><p>More than 40 years ago, a leading relativity theorist made a surprising prediction. Whereas empty space should feel immeasurably cold to any observer gliding along at a constant speed, one who is accelerating, say because he\'s riding a rocket, would find empty space hot. This so-called Unruh effect seemed practically impossible to measure, but now four theorists claim they have devised a doable experiment that could confirm the underlying physics. Skeptics say it will do no such thing&#8212;but for contradictory reasons.</p>\n\n<p>"The hope is that this will convince skeptics that the whole thing is coherent," says Stephen Fulling, a theoretical physicist and mathematician at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station who was not involved in the work. But Vladimir Belinski, a theorist at International Network of Centers for Relativistic Astrophysics in Pescara, Italy, says, "The Unruh effect is nonsense, it\'s based on a mathematical mistake."</p>\n\n<p>According to Albert Einstein\'s theories of special and general relativity, things can appear bizarrely different to observers in motion relative to one another. Suppose you stand next to a meter stick with a watch on your wrist. If your friend zips past at near&#8211;light-speed, she\'ll see that the stick is shorter than a meter and that your watch ticks abnormally slowly. Conversely, if she carries a meter stick, you\'ll see it contract and, to you, <em>her</em> watch will tick slowly.</p>\n\n<p>Things get even weirder if one observer accelerates. Any observer traveling at a constant speed will measure the temperature of empty space as absolute zero. But an accelerated observer will find the vacuum hotter. At least that\'s what William Unruh, a theorist at the University British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, argued in 1976. To a nonaccelerating observer, the vacuum is devoid of particles&#8212;so that if he holds a particle detector it will register no clicks. In contrast, Unruh argued, an accelerated observer will detect a fog of photons and other particles, as the number of quantum particles flitting about depends on an observer\'s motion. The greater the acceleration, the higher the temperature of that fog or "bath."</p>\n\n<p>The effect is too feeble to measure directly. To see the vacuum heat to 1 K, an observer would have to accelerate 100 quadrillion times faster than the best rocket can. But Daniel Vanzella, a theorist at the University of S&#227;o Paulo in S&#227;o Carlos, Brazil, and colleagues argue that it should be possible to detect the key thing&#8212;the fog of photons seen by the accelerating observer&#8212;by studying light radiated by electrons.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how that would work: Suppose you shoot a bunch of electrons laterally across a magnetic field. Basic physics dictates that the electrons will turn circles in the field. Now, apply a vertical electric field to also give the electrons an upward push. As well as circulating, the bunch of will also accelerate upward. The setup thus defines two frames of reference. In the frame accelerating upward with the bunch, the electrons turn circles (see figure). In the nonaccelerating "lab frame" the bunch traces a stretched corkscrew trajectory.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="graphic entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-figure"><h3 class="graphic__header">Testing the Unruh effect</h3>\n  <div class="graphic__body">\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The proposed experiment is a tale of two reference frames.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/040617SNOW_electronCorkskrew.jpg?itok=NFa5Og7r" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/040617SNOW_electronCorkskrew.jpg?itok=NFa5Og7r 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/040617SNOW_electronCorkskrew.jpg?itok=jYb7UaZl 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption"></div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      V. Altounian/<i>Science</i>, adapted from Adrian Cho  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure></figure><p>Vanzella and colleagues start their analysis in the accelerating frame, where they assume the circulating electrons encounter that fog of photons. The electrons will both absorb photons from and radiate photons into the fog. Weirdly, every event in the accelerated frame in which the electrons absorb or emit a photon corresponds to an event in the lab frame in which the electrons emit a photon. The theorists use relativity theory to&#160;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03446">predict the spectrum of emitted photons in the lab</a>&#160;frame, as they report in a paper in press at&#160;<cite>Physical Review Letters</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>In the lab frame, they calculate, the spectrum of emitted photons should have a tell-tale excess at long wavelengths&#8212;but only if there was a fog of photons in the accelerating frame to begin with, Vanzella says. Roughly speaking, the fog of photons in the accelerated frame heats up the electrons and makes them radiate a bit more in the lab frame. Thus, the experiment would provide a way to test whether the Unruh effect exists: Observe the excess of long-wavelength photons in the lab frame, and you\'ll know that the accelerated frame space is full of photons.</p>\n\n<p>Skeptics say the experiment won&#8217;t work, but they disagree on why. If the situation isproperly analyzed, there is no fog of photons in the accelerated frame, says Detlev Buchholz, a theorist at the University of G&#246;ttingen in Germany. "The Unruh gas does not exist!" he says. Nevertheless, Buchholz says, the vacuum will appear hot to an accelerated observer, but because of a kind of friction that arises through the interplay of quantum uncertainty and acceleration. So,the experiment might show the desired effect, but that wouldn\'t reveal the supposed fog of photons in the accelerating frame.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, Robert O\'Connell, a theorist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, insists that in the accelerated frame there is a fog of photons. However, he contends, it is not possible to draw energy out of that fog to produce extra radiation in the lab frame. O\'Connell cites a basic bit of physics called the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which states that a particle interacting with a heat bath will pump as much energy into the bath as it pulls out. Thus, he argues, Unruh\'s fog of photons exists, but the experiment should not produce the supposed signal anyway.</p>\n\n<p>The discord aside, George Matsas, a theorist also at S&#227;o Paulo State University and an author on the new paper says he&#8217;s looking for experimenters interested in performing the test. It could be done with particle accelerators and electromagnets currently available, Matsas says. "The parameters in the paper were chosen to be realistic," he says. Even if the experiment works as predicted, however, the debate over the Unruh effect seems likely to smolder on.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Does space heat up when you accelerate?

And for just as long, skeptics have scoffed on the grounds that sound waves coming from meteors should arrive several&#160;minutes&#160;<em>after</em> the light waves, which travel nearly a million times faster. Now, scientists have proposed a theory to explain how our eyes and ears could perceive a meteor at nearly the same time. The hypothesis might also explain how auroras produce sound, a claim made by many indigenous peoples living at high latitudes.</p>\n\n<p>Meteors&#160;release huge amounts of energy as they disintegrate in the atmosphere. They also produce low frequency radio waves that travel at the speed of light. Some scientists have suggested that those radio waves produce the sound that accompanies meteors. The waves can cause everyday objects&#8212;including fences, hair, and glasses&#8212;to vibrate, which our ears pick up as sound between 20 and 20,000 Hertz. This phenomenon, called electrophonics, is a well-known principle: &#8220;The conversion from electromagnetic waves to sound waves &#8230; is exactly how your radio works,&#8221; says Colin Price, an atmospheric scientist at Tel Aviv University in Israel and co-author of the new study. &#8220;But in this case nature provides the conversion between electromagnetic waves and acoustic waves.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>But nailing down that scenario isn&#8217;t easy. Reports of noisy meteors are relatively scarce&#8212;there were only 40 last year, according to the American Meteor Society (AMS). And because most of these &#8220;hearings&#8221; have been made by amateur sky watchers, it&#8217;s difficult to find audio recordings to back them up. &#8220;[We&#8217;ve] never had [a recording] cross our path,&#8221; says David Meisel in Geneseo, New York, executive director of AMS. Moreover, a key question remains to be answered: How do the meteors produce low-frequency radio waves in the first place?</p>\n\n<p>Now, Price and Michael Kelley, a physicist at Cornell University, have developed a model to answer that question. As a&#160;meteor&#160;streaks through Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, it ionizes the air around it, splitting it into heavy, positively charged ions and lighter, negatively charged electrons. The ions follow the meteor, whereas the electrons are deflected by Earth&#8217;s magnetic field. That separation of positive and negative charges in the meteor&#8217;s wake produces a large electric field that drives an electrical current. And <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL072911/full">it&#8217;s that current that launches the radio waves</a>, Price and Kelley hypothesize in an upcoming issue of <cite>Geophysical Research Letters</cite>. The size of the meteor and its speed through the atmosphere would control the frequency of the radio waves, they predict.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, another research team presented a different hypothesis <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep41251">to explain how meteors make sound</a>. That team proposed that visible light from a meteor heats up materials such as hair and glasses, which then vibrate and produce sound waves. But this theory requires a &#8220;huge&#8221; light source, Price says. Only meteors as bright as the full moon could emit enough light to produce such sound waves. But according to the new theory, all meteors generate radio waves that can produce sound, some of which our ears are capable of picking up.</p>\n\n<p>Price and Kelley suggest that their model might also explain reports of &#8220;clapping&#8221; sounds accompanying auroras, the colorful light displays created when charged particles from the sun collide with molecules in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere at high latitudes. These sounds feature prominently in stories of native peoples of the northern United States, Greenland, and Canada, but they have largely been dismissed by scientists. &#8220;Auroras also create radio waves that can easily reach the ground,&#8221; Kelley says. &#160;</p>\n\n<p>The new hypothesis is &#8220;reasonable,&#8221; says Meers Oppenheim, an astronomer at Boston University not involved in the study. But it&#8217;s difficult to simulate what&#8217;s truly going on 100 kilometers up in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere as tiny particles of dust whiz by at 50 or more kilometers per second. &#8220;The devil lies in the details, and no one seems to have truly worked through those,&#8221; he says.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="New theory may explain the &#8216;music of the meteors&#8217;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

But&#8212;as even they will tell you&#8212;they&#8217;re no match for the complexity of the human body. Heart attacks in particular are hard to anticipate. Now, scientists have shown that computers capable of teaching themselves can perform even better than standard medical guidelines, significantly increasing prediction rates. If implemented, the new method could save thousands or even millions of lives a year.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stress enough how important it is,&#8221; says Elsie Ross, a vascular surgeon at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved with the work, &#8220;and how much I really hope that doctors start to embrace the use of artificial intelligence to assist us in care of patients.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Each year, nearly 20 million people die from the effects of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks, strokes, blocked arteries, and other circulatory system malfunctions. In an effort to predict these cases, many doctors use guidelines similar to those of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA). Those are based on eight risk factors&#8212;including age, cholesterol level, and blood pressure&#8212;that physicians effectively add up.</p>\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s too simplistic to account for the many medications a patient might be on, or other disease and lifestyle factors. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of interaction in biological systems,&#8221; says Stephen Weng, an epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Some of those interactions are counterintuitive: A lot of body fat can actually protect against heart disease in some cases. &#8220;That&#8217;s the reality of the human body,&#8221; Weng says. &#8220;What computer science allows us to do is to explore those associations.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>In the new study, Weng and his colleagues compared use of the ACC/AHA guidelines with four machine-learning algorithms: random forest, logistic regression, gradient boosting, and neural networks. All four techniques analyze lots of data in order to come up with predictive tools without any human instruction. In this case, the data came from the electronic medical records of 378,256 patients in the United Kingdom. The goal was to find patterns in the records that were associated with cardiovascular events.</p>\n\n<p>First, the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms had to train themselves. They used about 78% of the data&#8212;some 295,267 records&#8212;to search for patterns and build their own internal &#8220;guidelines.&#8221; They then tested themselves on the remaining records. Using record data available in 2005, they predicted which patients would have their first cardiovascular event over the next 10 years, and checked the guesses against the 2015 records. Unlike the ACC/AHA guidelines, the machine-learning methods were allowed to take into account 22 more data points, including ethnicity, arthritis, and kidney disease.</p>\n\n<p>All four AI methods performed significantly better than the ACC/AHA guidelines. Using a statistic called AUC (in which a score of 1.0 signifies 100% accuracy), the ACC/AHA guidelines hit 0.728. The four new methods ranged from 0.745 to 0.764, Weng&#8217;s team reports this month in <cite>PLOS ONE</cite>. The best one&#8212;neural networks&#8212;correctly predicted 7.6% more events than the ACC/AHA method, and it raised 1.6% fewer false alarms. In the test sample of about 83,000 records, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0174944">that amounts to 355 additional patients whose lives could have been saved</a>. That&#8217;s because prediction often leads to prevention, Weng says, through cholesterol-lowering medication or changes in diet.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;This is high-quality work,&#8221; says Evangelos Kontopantelis, a data scientist at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom who works with primary care databases. He says that dedicating more computational power or more training data to the problem &#8220;could have led to even bigger gains.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Several of the risk factors that the machine-learning algorithms identified as the strongest predictors are not included in the ACC/AHA guidelines, such as severe mental illness and taking oral corticosteroids. Meanwhile, none of the algorithms considered diabetes, which is on the ACC/AHA list, to be among the top 10 predictors. Going forward, Weng hopes to include other lifestyle and genetic factors in computer algorithms to further improve their accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>Kontopantelis notes one limitation to the work: <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/brainlike-computers-are-black-box-scientists-are-finally-peering-inside">Machine-learning algorithms are like black boxes</a>, in that you can see the data that go&#160;in and the decision that comes out, but you can&#8217;t grasp what happens in between. That makes it difficult for humans to tweak the algorithm, and it thwarts predictions of what it will do in a new scenario.</p>\n\n<p>Will physicians soon adopt similar machine-learning methods in their practices? Doctors really pride themselves on their expertise, Ross says. &#8220;But I, being part of a newer generation, see that we can be assisted by the computer.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Self-taught artificial intelligence beats doctors at predicting heart attacks" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

The device can produce nearly 3 liters of water per day for every kilogram of spongelike absorber it contains, and researchers say future versions will be even better.

Over the years, researchers have developed ways to grab a few trickles, such as using fine nets to wick water from fog banks, or power-hungry dehumidifiers to condense it out of the air. But both approaches require either very humid air or far too much electricity to be broadly useful.</p>\n\n<p>To find an all-purpose solution, researchers led by Omar Yaghi, a chemist at the University of California, Berkeley, turned to a family of crystalline powders called metal organic frameworks, or MOFs. Yaghi developed the first MOFs&#8212;porous crystals that form continuous 3D networks&#8212;more than 20 years ago. The networks assemble in a Tinkertoy-like fashion from metal atoms that act as the hubs and sticklike organic compounds that link the hubs together. By choosing different metals and organics, chemists can dial in the properties of each MOF, controlling what gases bind to them, and how strongly they hold on.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past 2 decades chemists have synthesized more than 20,000 MOFs, each with unique molecule-grabbing properties. For example, Yaghi and others recently designed MOFs that absorb&#8212;and later release&#8212;methane,&#160;<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/538">making them a type of high-capacity gas tank</a>&#160;for natural gas&#8211;powered vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>In 2014, Yaghi and his colleagues synthesized a MOF that excelled at absorbing water, even under low-humidity conditions. That led him to reach out to Evelyn Wang, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, with whom he had previously worked on a project to use MOFs in automobile air conditioning. After synthesizing the new zirconium-based MOF, dubbed MOF-801, Yaghi met Wang at MIT and said, &#8220;Evelyn we have to come up with a water-harvesting device.&#8221; She agreed to give it a shot.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="graphic entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-figure"><h3 class="graphic__header">Device pulls water from the air</h3>\n  <div class="graphic__body">\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At night setup soaks up water vapor from air, and uses heat from the sun to release it as liquid water during the day.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/0413SNOWWaterHarvester.jpg?itok=jQssOzKk" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/0413SNOWWaterHarvester.jpg?itok=jQssOzKk 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/0413SNOWWaterHarvester.jpg?itok=G8IsPw7b 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption"></div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      V. Altounian/<i>Science</i>  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure></figure><p>The system Wang and her students designed consists of a kilogram of dust-sized MOF crystals pressed into a thin sheet of porous copper metal. That sheet is placed between a solar absorber and a condenser plate and positioned inside a chamber. At night the chamber is opened, allowing ambient air to diffuse through the porous MOF and water molecules to stick to its interior surfaces, gathering in groups of eight to form tiny cubic droplets. In the morning, the chamber is closed, and sunlight entering through a window on top of the device then heats up the MOF, which liberates the water droplets and drives them&#8212;as vapor&#8212;toward the cooler condenser. The temperature difference, as well as the high humidity inside the chamber, causes the vapor to condense as liquid water, which drips into a collector. The setup works so well that&#160;<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aam8743">it pulls 2.8 liters of water out of the air per day</a>&#160;for every kilogram of MOF it contained, the Berkeley and MIT team reports today in&#160;<cite>Science</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It has been a longstanding dream&#8221; to harvest water from desert air, says Mercouri Kanatzidis, a chemist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who wasn&#8217;t involved with the work. &#8220;This demonstration &#8230; is a significant proof of concept.&#8221; It&#8217;s also one that Yaghi says has plenty of room for improvement. For starters, zirconium costs $150 a kilogram, making water-harvesting devices too expensive to be broadly useful. However, Yaghi says his group has already had early success in designing water-grabbing MOFs that replace zirconium with aluminum, a metal that is 100 times cheaper. That could make future water harvesters cheap enough not only to slake the thirst of people in arid regions, but perhaps even supply water to farmers in the desert.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>*Update, 14 March, 12:28 p.m.:</strong>&#160;This item has been updated to reflect the fact that the device pulls nearly 3 liters of water out of the air for every kilogram of the water-absorbing material that is used.</em></p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="This new solar-powered device can pull water straight from the desert air" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

These methodologies are now important for bushlands that need vegetation and renewal, and they could be applied to Australian national parks and marine areas.</p>\n              <p>The march is important at several levels: I&#8217;m from a small town and there is a big movement back home to promote natural and sustainable farming in response to the trend toward big-business agriculture. The local river runs into the ocean, carrying run-off pollution that has caused algal blooms. At the national level, there is the Great Barrier Reef, where shipping and overfishing are killing the ocean and Australian marine biodiversity. Internationally, there is a domino effect in which the policies of the United States will influence policies here. For example, coal mining is also big in Australia, and those promoting mining are not looking into the environmental impact it will have over the next 50 years.</p>\n              <p>We need to be more inclusive in science. We should promote awareness of Aboriginal Australians&#8217; views and encourage all Aboriginal peoples interested in a science career to study and go for it. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/dennis-normile">Dennis Normile</a></i></p>\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Australia_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header black">Australia</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/18_cc_AUSTRALIA---Stuart-Khan-1_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Stuart Kahn</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p class="black">We&#8217;re up to about 10 marches</p>\n                    <footer class="black">Stuart Khan, 45, environmental engineer specializing in chemical contaminants in water at University of New South Wales in Sydney </footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I first heard of the March for Science through social media. We noticed a couple of march sites that started up in the United States. The response in Australia has not been as substantial as in the U.S., but I think it has been positive and relatively strong. We&#8217;re a bit disappointed that the big science associations are not participating. But we are up to about 10 marches. As for participation, we&#8217;ll find out on 22 April. If it doesn&#8217;t rain, we might have a few thousand in each city.</p>\n              <p>I have long been concerned about the alarmingly low level of appreciation for science exhibited by politicians in Australia as well as in other countries. I firmly believe that an improved appreciation for science holds the key to all of the great challenges we currently face. It&#8217;s not just climate change; the antivaccination and anti&#8211;water fluoridation movements are fairly big here. There is a general lack of trust in and respect for what science can tell us; people don&#8217;t know how much faith to put into science. If the science doesn&#8217;t suit their preconceived beliefs, people feel open to alternatives.</p>\n              <p>Science is very global. I collaborate with people in other countries every day, use data developed by other research groups, and make knowledge and information available to others. If science suffers in one country, the whole system suffers. Especially if that country has been contributing as much as the U.S. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/dennis-normile">Dennis Normile</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Austria">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Austria_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header black">Austria</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/19_cc_AUSTRIA---Renee-Schroeder_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Stefan Knittel</p>\n                <div class="card-text austria">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote black">\n                    <p class="black">Science has always had open borders</p>\n                    <footer class="black">Ren&#233;e Schroeder, 63, biochemist at the Max Perutz Laboratories in Vienna</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>On 22 April I would normally have been at a retreat with about 100 other scientists of our research project on RNA biology. But I was contacted by Oliver Lehman, the organizer of the march here in Vienna, and we have decided to skip lunch and cut the retreat short so that we can all take part in the March for Science.</p>\n              <p>It&#8217;s important to advocate for science. Antienlightenment sentiments are rising worldwide. Many Austrians are against genetic engineering but don&#8217;t know what a gene is, for instance. I have a problem with that. It&#8217;s almost fashionable to be against science nowadays.</p>\n              <p>But this march is part of a global movement that has really gained momentum after Trump&#8217;s inauguration. We had a similar situation here in Austria last year. There was a lot of fear that the populist Norbert Hofer would win the presidential elections, but a movement for enlightenment and tolerance, full of optimism, sprang up. This march feels like a continuation of that, and like science itself, it is international. Science has always had open borders, more so than nation states.</p>\n              <p>I think the march will be fairly big. We&#8217;re still discussing what signs we want to make. There will be tables set out along the route where people can do experiments and scientists can engage with the public. Saturday afternoon is a good time because there will be lots of people in the city. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/kai-kupferschmidt">Kai Kupferschmidt</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Germany">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Germany_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header black">Germany</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/11_cc_GERMANY---Martin-Stratmann_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Axel Griesch</p>\n                <div class="card-text germany">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p class="black">This is not a march against Trump</p>\n                    <footer class="black">Martin Stratmann, 62, electrochemist and president of Max Planck Society in Munich </footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>The last and only time I went to a protest was as a pupil. This was around 1968, and we were marching to change the school system, which was too hierarchical. This time I am marching for two reasons: One is that the employees at the Max Planck Society, the Ph.D. students, the directors, will be happy to see their president showing his support for the movement. And I have a strong personal motivation: Today, science is more important than ever before, but evidence and knowledge are being questioned in many places, including politics. Like many people, I have been following the political developments in the last 18 months with great concern. </p>\n              <p>This is a march pro-science and pro-facts, not a march against Trump. Of course, in the U.S., Trump has come to symbolize how little facts and evidence are currently being valued in politics, and that scientific freedom is restricted in part because results are politically inconvenient. But we face the same concerns in Europe; for example, a leading university is under threat in Hungary. In addition, the Max Planck Society has employees from all over the world&#8212;including from Iran, China, and Turkey. Many of these researchers know how science is restricted in their countries of origin. And that is often connected with restrictions of freedom in general. They want to say clearly that science should be free everywhere, that people should be free everywhere.</p>\n              <p>I expect the march in Munich to be very diverse. It&#8217;s a cosmopolitan city that has the highest density of science in Germany. I think that younger people especially will take the opportunity to march for their future. They will face the consequences of our global problems in their lifetimes. We have to spell out to society that we cannot solve these problems without science. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/kai-kupferschmidt">Kai Kupferschmidt</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Greenland">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Greenland_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Greenland</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/3_cc_GREENLAND----Michael-MacFerrin_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Horst Machguth</p>\n                <div class="card-text greenland">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>It will be a powerful image from this remote corner that people care</p>\n                    <footer>Mike MacFerrin, 37, graduate student in glaciology at the University of Colorado in Boulder </footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I decided early on that I would really like to go to the March for Science. I figured I could use some airline miles to get to D.C. Because I&#8217;m a field glaciologist, I was going to bring my parka, Baffin boots, and ski goggles. When the date was announced, I realized I was going to be in Greenland. Then about 3 minutes later, I realized there wasn&#8217;t any reason we couldn&#8217;t do it there. </p>\n              <p>Several other teams will be there, many from Europe, staging in Kangerlussuaq, a town of maybe 600 people. It has the main airport in Greenland; roughly half the town is employed by the airport. I got in touch with Nini Frydkj&#230;r Holstebro, a Greenlander and a friend, to make sure that local officials were OK with it. She&#8217;s a small business owner and a pillar of the community. </p>\n              <p>Due to the recent political turmoil here in the United States, I&#8217;ve become more active politically in the last year than I ever was in my life. Science in our country&#8212;and we&#8217;re not the only place&#8212;is coming under attack. Scientists are being portrayed as nefarious people. I work on a project funded by NASA&#8217;s Cryospheric Sciences Program, part of NASA&#8217;s earth science division. Trump recently proposed cuts to the division&#8212;at a really crucial time.</p>\n              <p> The changes we&#8217;re seeing in Greenland are dramatic. People in Kangerlussuaq have a reason to care. A bridge partly washed out in 2012, due to runoff from the ice sheet. I liken the attacks on science to turning off the headlights. We&#8217;re driving fast and people don&#8217;t want to see what&#8217;s coming up. Scientists&#8212;we&#8217;re the headlights. </p>\n              <p>I&#8217;ve spent a couple hundred dollars of my own money on a 12-foot banner. It says &#8220;March for Science, Greenland. Science not Silence.&#8221; I plan to put up signs around town. We&#8217;ll invite anyone who wants to come. We&#8217;ll walk from the port station to the bridge. It will be like three blocks. Then we&#8217;ll drive out to the ice sheet and get some photos. Our march is just one of many, but it will be a powerful image from this remote corner that people care. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/erik-stokstad">Erik Stokstad</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Iceland">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Iceland_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Iceland</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/9_ICELAND%20Erna_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Kristinn Ingvarsson, University of Iceland</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>This is one of the biggest things we&#8217;ve done for science in Iceland</p>\n                    <footer>Erna Magn&#250;sd&#243;ttir, 43, molecular biologist at the University of Iceland in Reykjavik and president of the Iceland Academy of Sciences</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>This is one of the biggest things we&#8217;ve done for science in Iceland. We&#8217;re going to march from a hill called Sk&#243;lav&#246;r&#240;uholt where there is a statue of Leif Erikson. That&#8217;s a bit symbolic. He discovered America, and now America is in trouble. We&#8217;re walking half a kilometer down to the center of the city. We&#8217;ll have a seminar with three speakers, talking about public policy and funding issues in Iceland. An American sociologist will tell us about the atmosphere in America.</p>\n              <p>We got the idea for the march just after the Trump administration took over. We saw a disregard for science. People got very scared for the future of the planet. First of all, it&#8217;s the issue of what the Trump administration will do about global warming.</p>\n              <p>It&#8217;s also the idea of informed policy, of evidence-based policies. We have to fight for that here in Iceland, like everywhere. Politicians use evidence when it fits their views. We feel like we&#8217;re shunned when it does not suit them. And we&#8217;re really struggling and fighting for proper funding of science. They&#8217;re cutting some of the competitive funds. We need 60% more funding to reach the average of [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] countries. This is not a very ambitious goal for a rich country.</p>\n              <p>The person leading the march, &#198;var &#222;or Benediktsson, is a bit of a TV celebrity here. He hosts a show for children about science and he also has a radio program. He&#8217;s a very positive, fun guy. One of the goals is to get people involved, to get them to think about science. Everyone should feel like they are part of science. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/erik-stokstad">Erik Stokstad</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Italy">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Italy_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Italy</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/8_cc_ValenteRdJ_16x9_0.jpg"><p class="credit">Courtesy Marco Valente</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>We feel there is a lack of respect towards academia</p>\n                    <footer>Marco Valente, 53, teaches Economics at the University of L&#8217;Aquila</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I am a member of a network of university researchers that promotes better policies for public universities and fights research cuts. When we learned about the March for Science in the United States, we thought we had good reasons to join them. Science is being challenged in Italy as well; scientific evidence is questioned, and it is often distorted for political needs. The way the Xylella fastidiosa outbreak in olive trees in southern Italy was handled; the vaccine debate, with the dramatic drop of vaccination rates; or the infamous Stamina case, where an unproven therapy was tested on humans due to media pressure, are good examples. Newspapers and political parties often depict science, research, and professors in negative terms. We feel there is a lack of respect towards academia. Many people don&#8217;t know how much authority to attribute to various sources of information.</p>\n              <p>We will participate in the march without any affiliation to specific groups and without a specific platform of demands. We just want to engage public opinion on the risk of losing scientific objectivity. Many people are letting us know they will support us, and we are beginning to receive the support of [nongovernmental organizations], universities, and research centers. </p>\n              <p>What do we expect? That people understand the difference between a scientific debate and a debate about the future of society. As an academic, I would also expect politicians to trust us more. For at least 10 years, politicians have only produced repressive policies for universities. They don&#8217;t see academia as a promoter of knowledge but as a teaching institution. Finally, we&#8217;d like to see more attention towards global warming, with effective policies and more pressure on the U.S. to force them to change their position. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/luca-tancredi-barone">Luca Tancredi Barone</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Japan">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Japan_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Japan</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/10_cc_JAPAN---Rintaro-Mori_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Courtesy Rintaro Mori </p>\n                <div class="card-text japan">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>Science provides an objective view that is important for decision-making</p>\n                    <footer>Rintaro Mori, 46, medical doctor and public health epidemiologist at the National Center for Child Health and Development in Tokyo and director of Cochrane Japan</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>This is the first time I have been involved in such an activity. I have a huge concern and also have professional and academic interests in the sustainability of our global society. I believe the scientific community has a very important role to address issues honestly, even challenging taboos, to provide objective information so as to achieve sustainable development. We&#8217;re not advocating for funding. Rather, science provides an objective view that is important for decision-making. Too many decisions are biased by vested interests, and this is leading our society in a wrong way. I think the march is a very good opportunity to help the general public recognize this important role of the scientific community.</p>\n              <p>One interesting phenomenon in this context is the use of the human papillomavirus vaccine. This is standard in many countries but Japan is well behind because of a series of events that created adverse publicity. The government has not been able to make a decision. The scientific community can help. </p>\n              <p>Cochrane is one of the organizations supporting the March for Science. I don&#8217;t think the march is very prominent in the Japanese community yet. I am discussing how we are going to participate with my colleagues. We are still waiting for approval from the police department. (There was a delay in applying for march permits.) There should be no problem. But without that we cannot circulate information about what we are doing. We wouldn&#8217;t expect a huge number of people. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/dennis-normile">Dennis Normile</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Mexico">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Mexico_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Mexico</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/16_MEXICO---Jaime-Urrutia-Fucugauchi_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">UNAM</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>We&#8217;ve realized we don&#8217;t want to focus too much on Trump</p>\n                    <footer>Jaime Urrutia Fucugauchi, 63, a geophysicist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City and president of the Mexican Academy of Sciences</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I heard about the March for Science when the academy received an invitation to participate from AAAS [<cite>Science</cite>&#8217;s publisher]. Another group was already organizing a march for science down Reforma Avenue, but I have had no luck getting in touch with them. So the academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine got together and decided to organize a parallel rally outside of the Palacio de Miner&#237;a, a landmark colonial building downtown that used to be an engineering school.</p>\n              <p>At first the main motivation was Donald Trump&#8217;s policies, especially about immigration. Limitations on visas could affect thousands of Mexican students and researchers, even those who simply want to attend a scientific meeting in the U.S. Maintaining international collaborations and openness benefits everyone. The fact that the U.S. has been able to attract the best students from around the world has been a source of strength and richness for the country. Mexico has more students in the U.S. than in any other country, and we also have many engineers working at NASA, for example.</p>\n              <p>But as the organizing has gone on, we&#8217;ve realized we don&#8217;t want to focus too much on Trump. We want to send a larger message about how important science is for Mexico&#8217;s economic development and how it can create change in our country</p>\n              <p>There isn&#8217;t a long history of activism for science in Mexico. Political protests happen all the time in Mexico City, and they don&#8217;t seem to change anything. Many people here don&#8217;t see the point of marching for anything anymore. Our challenge is to overcome people&#8217;s apathy and convince them to participate in this one, which we hope will be part of a global movement. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/lizzie-wade">Lizzie Wade</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Netherlands">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Netherlands_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Netherlands</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/12_cc_NETHERLANDS---Karen-Maex-%282%29_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">UvA</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>I&#8217;m in.

Absolutely. Academic freedom is one of the most important issues to me, and recent developments in Europe have threatened it. The Hungarian government has signed a decree that targets and silences Central European University. I don&#8217;t need to tell you that many academics in Turkey have been arrested and detained. I find that very worrisome. I&#8217;m concerned about the United States as well. Climate science is often sidelined without proper arguments and people promote &#8216;alternative facts&#8217; that have no basis in academic research. Of course there are issues in the Netherlands as well, but they&#8217;re a different order of magnitude.</p>\n              <p>I&#8217;m not the type of rector to start recruiting people for the march. This is not something that should come from the board; people can make up their own minds. But I know the issue is very widely discussed, and I think there will be a big delegation from our university, both students and staff. I know that rectors of several other universities are joining as well. This is something that the academic community in the Netherlands feels strongly about and we hope to send a clear message. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/martin-enserink">Martin Enserink</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="NewZealand">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/NewZealand_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">New Zealand</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/1_cc_NEW-ZELAND---Craig-Stevens_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Aitana Forc&#233;n-V&#225;zquez</p>\n                <div class="card-text newzealand">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>Trump was the thing that initiated it</p>\n                    <footer>Craig Stevens, physical oceanographer at the University of Auckland, president of the New Zealand Association of Scientists</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>Because of the time difference, we were the first place in the world to march for women and we can be the first to march for scientists. We expect to have three or four marches around the country. Mind you, we are a country of just 3 to 4 million, with 11,000 scientists and an equal number of research students. And the march is not just for scientists; anyone who values science can participate. I&#8217;m going to be a speaker. I&#8217;m tentatively scheduled to talk at the Wellington march, but it&#8217;s not coming together as strongly as the one in Auckland, so I might go up to there.</p>\n              <p>Trump was the thing that initiated it; we even put out a press release about his election. We have issues here but if it were not for the new U.S. administration, they would not have been enough to get us into the streets. As president of the society, we advocate for science and reject pseudoscience. We try to inject science into policy. We are a small player, so we depend on results from the rest of the world. There&#8217;s a big concern that if there&#8217;s an overall downturn in science, it will embolden people locally and internationally to cease to value the view of science.</p>\n              <p>For New Zealand, this march comes at a good time. This is an election year and the march puts science more firmly in the political picture. It will raise the appreciation of science. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/elizabeth-pennisi">Elizabeth Pennisi</a></i></p>\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/NewZealand_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">New Zealand</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/13_NEW%20ZEALAND%20Nicola%20Gaston_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Colin MacDiarmid</p>\n                <div class="card-text newzealand2">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>I feel everyone should know about it</p>\n                    <footer>Nicola Gaston, physicist at the University of Auckland; helped organize the March for Science in New Zealand, but will be in the United States on 22 April and hopes to march in Washington, D.C.</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I am planning to march because I believe in society. We need to stand up for things we believe in, whether that is science, knowledge, or the value of evidence-based policy and informed democratic discourse. I feel like everyone should know about it, but the reality is that many New Zealanders have more important things to worry about than the status of science!</p>\n              <p>Because science careers are often international, we need to stand in solidarity with our colleagues in the U.S. who are affected by the politicization of science and loss of funding. But even more than that, I am concerned with the dismissal of scientific and other forms of knowledge as the basis for rational conversation, and ultimately agreement within society. In New Zealand, former Prime Minister <a href="http://www.noted.co.nz/archive/listener-nz-2011/john-keys-unhappy-week-at-the-bbc/" target="_blank">John Key famously said about scientist Mike Joy</a>, who has raised concern about the impact of the dairy industry on freshwater quality, &#8216;He&#8217;s one academic, and like lawyers, I can provide you with another one that will give you a counter view.&#8217;</p>\n              <p>After the march is over, I think we are going to see a lot more soul searching within the scientific community about the purpose of a march, whether it has achieved anything, and whether more collective action, perhaps internationally, is necessary in order to make progress on the issues that have been raised. One of the big issues is the issue of diversity in the scientific community, which is being widely discussed using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/marginsci?lang=en" target="_blank">#marginsci</a>. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/elizabeth-pennisi">Elizabeth Pennisi</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Norway">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Norway_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Norway</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/15_cc_NORWAY---Annette-Bayer_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Stefan Amlie/UiT </p>\n                <div class="card-text norway">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>This may be the most northern March for Science</p>\n                    <footer>Annette Bayer, 45, chemist at the Arctic University of Norway in Troms&#248;</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I think this may be the most northern March for Science. It will start at one of the research institutes and go through the city center. In April, the weather in Troms&#248; can be everything from snow, to rain, to sun. I have a feeling that people are determined to attend. The Norwegians in general are not very sensitive to weather. We say, &#8216;There&#8217;s never bad weather, only bad clothing.&#8217;</p>\n              <p>My first reaction was that I wanted to participate to support my colleagues in the U.S. When I thought more about it, I realized it&#8217;s not just in the U.S.; supporting and recognizing the importance of knowledge is a global issue. There are issues in Norway related to resources, particularly oil and fisheries. If you want to use resources sustainably, it&#8217;s important to base your decision on knowledge.</p>\n              <p>It will be the first demonstration I have ever participated in. I think it&#8217;s really important that people understand that most scientists work for the benefit of all of us. At the moment, my colleagues and I are doing research in the field of using [carbon dioxide] as a carbon source to make drugs, fuels, and plastics, instead of using oil. The other topic we work on is antibiotic resistance. It&#8217;s a good example of how ignoring knowledge can have important consequences for global health.</p>\n              <p>There are marches all over the world. It would be very nice if that would encourage politicians as well as industrial leaders to really make decisions based on facts and not belief. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/erik-stokstad">Erik Stokstad</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Poland">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Poland_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Poland</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/17_POLAND---Justyna-Wojniak_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Justyna Wojniak</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>We are planning a day filled with small events</p>\n                    <footer>Justyna Wojniak, 38, educational policy researcher at the Pedagogical University of Krak&#243;w and spokesperson for the Polish Women Scientists Network</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>This is the first march the network participates in. The Polish march has not been organized as an action against Donald Trump, although his international policy certainly worries us. In Poland, we are facing many other issues of concern. The right-wing government and conservative majority in the Parliament have introduced several changes to the legal system and new regulations for public institutions that many Polish people perceive as a serious threat to democracy.</p>\n              <p>In the field of science, the government recently announced serious changes to the university system without widely consulting the scientific community. The main goal, it seems, is to make the university an entrepreneurial institution driven by market rules, competition, flexible employment, and cooperation with industry. There is now pressure and censorship on researchers in the social sciences and humanities to favor conservative and religious ideology. Polish science has other problems as well. It lacks a transparent granting system, a simple academic career path, and clear rules for promotion.</p>\n              <p>We are planning a day filled with small events at different locations in Warsaw, including a lecture on the role of science in politics and society, workshops, and scientific caf&#233;s. We hope that the informal atmosphere will enable the public to feel that they are touching science and that science really matters in their everyday lives. We would also like to be heard and treated seriously by the minister of science and higher education. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/elisabeth-pain">Elizabeth Pain</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Portugal">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Portugal_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Portugal</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/4_PORTUGAL---Carlos-Moedas_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">European Union, 2017/Nicolas Kovarik</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>Science is not a dispensable luxury</p>\n                    <footer>Carlos Moedas, European commissioner for research, science and innovation in Brussels.</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I&#8217;m really proud that the call for the March for Science resonated in so many countries and that a march is organized in my home country, Portugal. About 480 marches are planned&#8212;for now&#8212;on the 22nd of April: It shows the broad support across the globe for research and science.</p>\n              <p>Science is not a dispensable luxury. We need science for the advancement of our societies and to inform our education, improve our policies, and spur innovation. Science, as a common good, also helps all of us to make sense of and navigate the more and more complex world we live in. So when special interests threaten scientific evidence and long-term research and when access to and diffusion of science is hampered, we have to stand up in support of the scientific community.</p>\n              <p>As the EU commissioner for research, science and innovation, I&#8217;m very proud to stand up for science and join the march in Lisbon. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/elisabeth-pain">Elizabeth Pain</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Spain">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Spain_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header black">Spain</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/14_ccEP_SPAIN---Nazario-Marti%CC%81n-Leo%CC%81n_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Courtesy of Nazario Mart&#237;n</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p class="black">The global and local issues go hand in hand</p>\n                    <footer class="black">Nazario Mart&#237;n, organic chemist at the Complutense University of Madrid and president of the Confederation of Scientific Societies of Spain (COSCE)</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I have marched for science in the past, but this march is pretty unique because it originated in the United States in response to the denial of demonstrated scientific facts like evolution and global warming by Trump and his cabinet. This is no joke: It represents a threat for science and could affect the health and the future of our planet. Countries in Europe are reacting to this tsunami from the United States by defending science not only globally but also within their own national context. The global and local issues go hand in hand.</p>\n              <p>In Spain, the situation is worrying because our political leadership shows no interest in empowering science. The government budget for 2017 represents a 2.6% decrease for research projects and institutions. The National Research Agency that the scientific community had been demanding for years is now starting operations, but it lacks the multiyear funding and scientific independence that were originally promised. All in all, we demand more financial support for research but also a better representation of science in politics.</p>\n              <p>There isn&#8217;t much of a tradition of marches and protests among Spanish scientists, so at COSCE we launched a manifesto for science, in the hope to make up for a possible lack of physical support in Madrid on 22 April. We will be meeting representatives of the Spanish Parliament on 26 April and it would be great if we could gather the signatures of several thousands of scientists. I am also hoping that the public realizes the importance of science for social progress and welfare, and will join the march and the manifesto. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/elisabeth-pain">Elizabeth Pain</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="SouthKorea">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/SouthKorea_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header black">South Korea</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/2_cc_SOUTH-KOREA---Eun-Kyoung-Jee_16x9.jpg?itok=shWCKHOp"><p class="credit">Courtesy Eun-Kyoung Jee</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p class="black">We will highlight the need for more women scientists and engineers</p>\n                    <footer class="black">Eun-Kyoung Jee, first-year graduate student in chemistry at Pohang University of Science and Technology </footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I have an interest in communication between scientists and the public. I have loved science for a long time and when I talk to people about science I realize it is separate from their lives, especially in Korea. We have people who reject using chemical products such as bleach, detergent, and toothpaste. We say they have &#8216;chemophobia.&#8217; It&#8217;s similar to the antivaccine feelings in the United States. I have a concern about this because my major is chemistry. I am also really concerned that the divide between science and the public will become more vast under Trump&#8217;s administration. This will be felt in the U.S. at first but the effect will spread worldwide because of the power of the United States.</p>\n              <p>I heard about the march at a meeting of Femicircuit, a union of women science and engineering students, faculty, and graduates affiliated with top Korean universities. The environment is not favorable for women. There are numerous inequalities and inconveniences. There are even fewer toilets for women in science and engineering buildings. Our goals are to talk about this and make an environment that is equal. Maybe 16 or 17 members of Femicircuit will participate, and we&#8217;ll have an information booth to highlight the need for more women scientists and engineers. The March for Science is occurring all over the world, and we are trying to make participants here feel they are part of a global effort. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/dennis-normile">Dennis Normile</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Uganda">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Uganda_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Uganda</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/7_cc_UGANDA---Clet-Wandui-Masiga_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Tropical Institute of Development Innovations</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>Everyone is upbeat and excited about the event</p>\n                    <footer>Clet Wandui Masiga, 41, plant and livestock geneticist at the Tropical Institute of Development Innovations in Entebbe</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I evaluate biotechnology that might be developed in Uganda, mostly plant varieties. When we got information about the event organized in Washington, D.C., we thought, &#8216;Yes, it is a really important thing to do for Uganda.&#8217; We have come together with the National Agricultural Research Organisation and other groups to show solidarity and to demonstrate to Uganda and the world at large that science has evolved over time and we cannot do without it.</p>\n              <p>We are going to march from the ministry of science and technology for about 5 kilometers through the main street of Kampala. We are going to carry placards with information on how science has been useful, and some of the tools that we no longer think we need to use, like the hand hoe. We have other technology like genetically engineered crops that are resistant to herbicides. We don&#8217;t want this hoe. It is breaking our backs. We will carry all the old models of phones. We will carry herbal medicine.</p>\n              <p>When we get to the Parliament, one of us will read a petition. We have requested that the speaker of the Parliament talk to us about the government&#8217;s position on science and technology. They should pass the National Biotechnology and Biosafety Bill. That will allow the government to regulate genetically engineered crops in a manner that is safe. </p>\n              <p>We are going to have farmers, professionals, civil servants, and politicians in the march. When we contacted the police for clearance, they said police officers can also participate, because it is nonpolitical. The police have a brass band. A band is very good at mobilizing people. Everyone is upbeat and excited about the event. It&#8217;s going to be historical. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/erik-stokstad">Erik Stokstad</a></i></p>\n              \n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="UnitedKingdom">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/UK_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">United Kingdom</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/6_UNITED%20KINGDOM%20Roger%20Highfield_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">ASSOCIATED PRESS</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>The march is a jolly good thing</p>\n                    <footer>Roger Highfield, director of external affairs at the Science Museum in London</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <p>I strongly support the march for a host of reasons, which I articulated <a href="https://sciencemarch.london/showing-solidarity/" target="_blank">in a blog I wrote for the London march</a>. I think that we are entering unchartered waters in this era of &#8216;Brex-ump&#8217; and, more than ever, the world needs science; after all, through technology, it is the dominant force on modern culture. (And yes, all you snobs out there, culture is as much about science as it is about the performing arts!)</p>\n            <p>I am alarmed by the rise of rhetoric that mocks experts, uneasy about whether the lifeblood of science&#8212;the global movement of people and ideas&#8212;will pump so freely in the era of Brex-ump and dismayed by &#8216;policy-based evidencemaking,&#8217; which includes moves to curtail research that challenges government dogma with inconvenient truths. And, yes, I do think this is indeed a global issue. In a nutshell, though I cannot make it for personal reasons, I think the march is a jolly good thing. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/daniel-clery">Daniel Clery</a></i></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>  \n</div>\n<span property="dc:title" content="Marchers around the world tell us why they\'re taking to the streets for science" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Slap it in front of a unit of concentration, such as molar, and it means that something exists in an extraordinarily small amount&#8212;think one part per quintillion. That&#8217;s the realm of SHERLOCK, a new diagnostic system that can detect attomolar levels of viruses in a sample and also distinguish Zika from its close relative, dengue. This exquisitely sensitive and specific tool promises to help detect diseases that other diagnostics miss, and it&#8217;s simple and cheap to use. Sexier still, it exploits a variation of CRISPR, the genome-editing method that has become the rage in biology.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very nice work and very well done,&#8221; says Erik Sontheimer, an RNA specialist who did early CRISPR work and is at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester. Harvard University&#8217;s George Church, who co-founded a CRISPR therapeutics company with one of SHERLOCK&#8217;s inventors but is not involved with this work, sums up his reaction in one word: &#8220;Wow.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Scientists recognized as early as 2010 that they might be able to transform CRISPR into a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2976250/">virus detection device</a>. But earlier efforts at making a viral detector became overshadowed by <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/topic/crispr">CRISPR&#8217;s wild success at editing genomes</a>. In those CRISPR applications, scientists fashion a short strip of RNA that guides a DNA-cutting enzyme called Cas9 to precise locations anywhere in a genome. The CRISPR-Cas9 scissors can cripple genes or make way for labs to add new DNA at the point of the cut, which has launched a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/how-battle-lines-over-crispr-were-drawn">billion-dollar industry</a> searching for new medicines and improved crops&#8212;and sparked serious <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/12/inside-summit-human-gene-editing-reporter-s-notebook">ethical debates</a> about the potential to enhance humans.</p>\n\n<p>SHERLOCK differs from the CRISPR-Cas9 system in fundamental ways. It uses an RNA guide that gloms onto RNA, not DNA, and an enzyme called Cas13a cuts the genetic material. Once Cas13a snips the target, it starts indiscriminately cutting any RNA it encounters. A team lead by bioengineer James Collins and CRISPR genome-editing pioneer Feng Zhang, both from the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has now shown that these &#8220;collateral&#8221; cuts can form the basis for the SHERLOCK diagnostic. &#8220;Nature has a lot of very amazing tools,&#8221; Zhang says. The researchers demonstrate that SHERLOCK can detect viral and bacterial infections, cancer mutations found at low frequencies, and subtle DNA sequence variations known as single nucleotide polymorphisms that are linked to other diseases. (SHERLOCK, a somewhat strained acronym coined by the team, stands for specific high sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking.)</p>\n\n<p>To exploit SHERLOCK for detecting small amounts of virus, the researchers spiked samples containing Zika or dengue virus with so-called fluorescent reporter RNA. When this RNA is cut, it effectively shoots off fluorescent flares. The team then unleashed Cas13a connected to a bit of RNA that targeted genetic sequences from either Zika or dengue. Once Cas13a found and sliced even a few viral sequences, it subsequently snipped the fluorescent reporters and created a detectable signal indicating the presence of the virus, the team <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aam9321">reports today</a> in <cite>Science</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers jiggered the system to also make it work on DNA targets&#8212;including cancer mutations in human genomes&#8212;by using enzymes that convert them to RNA. &#8220;It works great for both types of nucleic acid,&#8221; says Broad bioengineer and first author Jonathan Gootenberg, stressing that the real advantage of Cas13a is that it has the collateral activity and can trigger the fluorescent reporter.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;There are exciting opportunities to use such systems for diagnostics in the future,&#8221; says Jennifer Doudna, a structural biologist at the University of California (UC), Berkeley, who helped lead a team that <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6096/816.long">first showed</a> in 2012 how CRISPR-Cas9 could edit DNA. (UC is in a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/round-one-crispr-patent-legal-battle-goes-broad-institute">pitched patent battle</a> with the Broad over those initial discoveries.) In 2011, Doudna co-founded a company to focus on creating diagnostics with CRISPR&#8212;it was <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=9260752&amp;OS=9260752&amp;RS=9260752">awarded a patent</a> for this&#8212;but it now mainly pursues genome engineering. A study Doudna co-authored that <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v538/n7624/full/nature19802.html">appeared last year</a> in <em>Nature </em>described how Cas13 could be used as a sensitive detection system with a fluorescent RNA reporter, but it did not go into the detail of the new work. &#8220;It&#8217;s gratifying to see that this new paper builds on our core idea of using [Cas13] to detect transcripts, and that our results were so helpful to their engineering efforts,&#8221; she says.</p>\n\n<p>The detection sensitivity of the new CRISPR-Cas13a system for specific genetic material is 1 million times better than the most commonly used diagnostic technique, which detects proteins and is known in shorthand as ELISA. It&#8217;s also 1000 times more sensitive than a CRISPR-based Zika virus diagnostic the Collins lab described last year in a <a href="http://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)30505-0"><cite>Cell</cite> paper</a>. SHERLOCK not only makes it easier to find infections or cancer mutations that less sensitive diagnostics can miss, says Collins, but the remarkable attomolar detection ability means the test works far more quickly, too.</p>\n\n<p>A SHERLOCK diagnostic that puts the needed chemicals on a piece of glass fiber paper can be quickly designed for most any RNA or DNA target, made rugged enough for field use, and could cost as little as 61 cents per test, say the study&#8217;s authors. This could greatly help during outbreaks of new infectious diseases, which often occur in poor countries and are difficult to accurately diagnose.</p>\n\n<p>Collins says the Broad is now &#8220;aggressively exploring&#8221; how to commercialize SHERLOCK and may launch a startup company. But before a diagnostic comes to market, it must pass muster at regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="New CRISPR tool can detect tiny amounts of viruses" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Trees are important for timber, food, and medicine, but getting a handle on the world&#8217;s thousands of tree species is a tough task. Up until this year, there\'s been no complete census. Now, researchers have published the first global database of tree species and their geographical ranges, a &#8220;huge scientific effort,&#8221; the team reports in the <em>Journal of Sustainable Forestry</em>. The scientists compiled the searchable online&#160;<a href="https://www.bgci.org/global_tree_search.php">archive</a>, which includes over 60,000 tree species, using data from a variety of sources such as museums, botanical gardens, and agricultural institutions. They found that Brazil, Colombia, and Indonesia were the <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10549811.2017.1310049">countries with the most tree species</a>&#8212;each is home to at least 5000. And nearly 60% of the world&#8217;s trees are native to just one country, the team noted. This database, which will be continuously updated, should allow researchers, policymakers, and the public to better monitor tree diversity and efforts to conserve specific species in forests, the scientists suggest. It will also form the basis of the Global Tree Assessment, an effort to document the conservation status of each tree species before the end of the decade.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="How many tree species are there?

Just imagine what scientists could see if they could also <em>make</em> things bigger. A new strategy to blow brains up does just that. Researchers previously invented a method for injecting a polyacrylate mesh into brain tissue, the same water-absorbing and expanding molecule that makes dirty diapers swell up. Just add water, and the tissue enlarges to 4.5 times its original size. But it wasn&#8217;t good enough to see everything. The brain is full of diminutive protrusions called dendritic spines lining the signal receiving end of a neuron. Hundreds to thousands of these nubs help strengthen or weaken an individual dendrite&#8217;s connection to other neurons in the brain. The nanoscale size of these spines makes studying them with light microscopes impossible or blurry at best, however. Now, the same group has overcome this barrier in an improved method called iterative expansion microscopy, described today in <em>Nature Methods</em>. Here, the tissue is expanded once, the crosslinked mesh is cleaved, and then the tissue is expanded again, <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nmeth.4261">resulting in roughly 20-fold enlargement</a>. Neurons are then visualized by light-emitting molecules linked to antibodies which latch onto specified proteins. The technique has yielded detailed images showing the formation of proteins along synapses in mice, as well as detailed renderings of dendritic spines (seen in the image above) in the mouse hippocampus&#8212;a center or learning and memory in the brain. The advance could enable neuroscientists to map the many individual connections between neurons across the brain and the unique arrangement of receptors that turn brain circuits on and off.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="By blowing up brain tissue to 20 times its size, scientists see unprecedented details " class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

By carefully chipping away at the end of a chalky tube (seen in photo above), researchers found a long, black, wormlike mass oozing from its casing&#8212;the first live specimen of the giant shipworm <em>Kuphus polythalamia</em>. The animal&#8217;s length makes it the longest of any living bivalve, a class of typically small critters including clams, oysters, and scallops. And as far as shipworms go, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6276/901.full">which usually burrow into and feed on wood</a> from ships or sunken trees, <em>K. polythalamia</em> is unique for squatting down and making a home in ocean mud. A look at their digestive tracts indicates that <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1620470114">these creatures don&#8217;t eat&#8212;or poop&#8212;a whole lot</a>, the researchers report today in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Wood-munching microbes on the sea floor expel hydrogen sulfide, the molecule responsible for the distinctive smell of rotting eggs. A different set of microbes living in the gills of <em>K. polythalamia</em> uses this hydrogen sulfide as an energy source to make carbon molecules that help sustain their shipworm host. The researchers suggest that studying the shipworms&#8217; transition from eating wood to relying on sulfur might help illuminate the evolution of animals such as deep sea mussels and giant tube worms that consume hydrogen sulfide from hydrothermal vents on deep ocean sea floors.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Giant shipworms discovered hiding in sulfurous lagoons" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

The island&#8217;s now-famous predator-prey study has tracked how wolf and moose numbers have risen and fallen in tandem over the decades, and left their mark on the island&#8217;s ecology.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>In contrast to&#160;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/extreme-inbreeding-likely-spells-doom-isle-royale-wolves">last year&#8217;s winter study</a>, when wolf tracks were the only evidence of the predators, wildlife ecologist Rolf Peterson spotted both wolves sitting on lake ice on the January afternoon he arrived on the island.&#160; Weeks later, Peterson and co-investigator John Vucetich, both of Michigan Technological University in Houghton, found the wolves feeding on a freshly-killed moose calf. &#8220;We were very lucky,&#8221; Peterson says. &#8220;There was no mystery left in terms of the wolf population,&#8221; or what they were eating.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>The researchers also observed that, in what normally would have been the wolves&#8217; breeding period, the 7-year-old female bared her teeth in response to the close interest of the 9-year-old male; he is both her father and half sibling.&#160; Researchers don&#8217;t expect the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article-abstract/108/2/120/2667696/Genomic-Variation-of-Inbreeding-and-Ancestry-in">highly inbred pair</a> to reproduce.</p>\n\n<p>The two wolves otherwise appeared healthy and still have all their canines, a key sign of well-being in the carnivores. The pair has already surpassed the average Isle Royale wolf lifespan of 4 years, dodging the main causes of death for their ancestors on the island: other wolves and starvation. &#8220;They are swimming in moose,&#8221; Vucetich says.</p>\n\n<p>The four wolf-killed carcasses the researchers spotted made little dent in the overall moose population, estimated at 1600 in aerial surveys conducted this past winter.&#160; The 20% increase from last winter is consistent with the population&#8217;s growth rate over the past 6 years, as <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/04/inbred-wolf-population-isle-royale-collapses">the inbred wolf population dwindled and collapsed</a>.&#160; Both beaver and moose abundance have tripled since 2011, &#8220;undoubtedly because of lack of predation,&#8221; Vucetich says.</p>\n\n<p>With moose density on the Guam-sized island already five to ten times higher than on the mainland--and with the numbers on track to double in three to four years&#8212;browsing on the island&#8217;s vegetation is intense. One aquatic plant, floating watershield (<em>Brassenia&#160; schreberi</em>), which was abundant six years ago when moose were at historic lows, now thrives in ponds only where moose are excluded. &#8220;It&#8217;s the aquatic equivalent of deforestation,&#8221; says plant ecologist Eric Hellquist of SUNY Oswego, noting that moose&#8217;s effect on aquatic vegetation is not as well studied as that on terrestrial plants. Isle Royale&#8217;s ponds are demonstrating &#8220;how apex predators can have cascading effects on food webs.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n<p>As the effects of the missing predators ripple through the island, the Park Service is assessing about 5000 public comments on <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/12/reversal-us-park-service-aims-move-new-wolves-isle-royale">its proposal to introduce 20 to 30 wolves</a> to the island to establish a new population. The next steps on that plan are expected by the end of this year.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Two wolves survive in world&#8217;s longest running predator-prey study " class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

But hundreds of attempts helped few patients. Now, a new approach that tailors a personalized vaccine to the mutated proteins in an individual&#8217;s tumor appears to have prevented early relapses in 12 people with skin cancer. It also may have helped several others by boosting the power of a new type of cancer drug that uses a different mechanism to unleash an immune attack on the tumor.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in this very exciting, new moment&#8221; for personalized cancer vaccines, says Catherine Wu of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, whose team presented results last week at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Washington, D.C. A second team has similarly encouraging data. The two small studies, mainly designed to test safety and immune responses, are indeed &#8220;promising,&#8221; says Drew Pardoll of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. But, he cautions, it is &#8220;way too early&#8221; to draw firm conclusions about whether the vaccines will extend the lives of cancer patients.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas earlier, unsuccessful cancer vaccines usually targeted a single distinctive cancer protein shared among patients, these new ones contain multiple mutated proteins, or &#8220;neoantigens,&#8221; that are specific to an individual patient&#8217;s tumor. Giving patients a dose of their tumor neoantigens, which look foreign to the immune system, should help activate immune cells called T cells to attack the cancer cells.</p>\n\n<p>A study <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/04/personalized-cancer-vaccines-may-fight-tumors">published 2 years ago in <cite>Science</cite></a> suggested the strategy might work: It showed that a neoantigen vaccine stimulated immune responses in three advanced melanoma patients who had already received a cancer drug. But at the time researchers couldn&#8217;t say much about whether the vaccine would help curb cancer growth.</p>\n\n<p>One new study was conducted in six patients with melanoma that had spread to their lymph nodes and sometimes other sites. The patients&#8217; tumors had been removed surgically, but were likely to regrow. Wu&#8217;s team sequenced the DNA from each patient&#8217;s tumors and used computational methods to predict mutations that coded for neoantigens. Then they made each patient a personal vaccine containing about 20 of these neoantigens. The researchers injected the vaccine under the patients&#8217; skin periodically for 5 months. They had no serious side effects and showed &#8220;strong, potent T cell responses&#8221; specific to many of their vaccine neoantigens, says Wu, whose collaborator Nir Hacohen of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reported the results at the AACR meeting. All are now cancer-free up to 32 months later.</p>\n\n<p>The two patients with the most advanced disease did relapse, but Wu&#8217;s team deployed an additional weapon: an immunotherapy drug called a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor. These antibody drugs <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/05/cancer-immunotherapy-takes-aim-mutation-riddled-tumors">block receptors on T cells that tumors use to hide from the immune system</a>. On their own, the drugs have vanquished tumors in people with certain cancers who otherwise had no hope. In metastatic melanoma they help up to 40% of patients, but in only 5% do tumors disappear completely. When the two relapsed patients in Wu&#8217;s study received a PD-1 inhibitor, their new tumors vanished.</p>\n\n<p>Similar results come from an international trial using a vaccine developed by Ugur Sahin of University Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany. The team injected RNA coding for up to 10 tumor neoantigens into the lymph nodes of 13 advanced melanoma patients whose tumors had been removed. Eleven remain cancer-free up to 26 months later, including two whose tumors reappeared, then shrank or were surgically removed, Sahin says. Another patient whose cancer returned received a PD-1 inhibitor and is also tumor-free.</p>\n\n<p>Sahin&#8217;s and Wu&#8217;s results have been submitted for publication. Two of three patients from the first clinical test published 2 years ago are also in remission more than 2.5 years later, one after relapsing and then receiving a PD-1 inhibitor, says trial leader Gerald Linette of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>\n\n<p>Pardoll and others caution, however, that it&#8217;s not possible to know whether neoantigen vaccines perform better than a PD-1 inhibitor alone without doing larger studies. Other questions remain about how best to design and deliver neoantigen vaccines. Right now the vaccines are costly and take months to make, which may be too long for some patients with metastatic disease.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, several biotech companies are launching trials combining neoantigen vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors for various cancers, including Neon Therapeutics in Cambridge, which Wu and Hacohen co-founded.</p>\n\n<p>The Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy in San Francisco, California, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/qa-what-can-250-million-achieve-chief-new-cancer-immunotherapy-institute-explains">launched a year ago</a> by Napster co-founder and biotech billionaire Sean Parker, is trying to figure out how to tailor the best possible vaccines through a competition. Thirty companies and academic groups will receive the same set of tumor samples from individual patients and will try to predict the best neoantigens. The Parker Institute and another sponsor will test them with lab assays, then feed back the results so participants can improve their algorithms. Says Parker Institute Vice President for Research Fred Ramsdell: &#8220;At the end, we&#8217;ll have a good idea of how to correctly pick neoantigens for a vaccine.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Personalized tumor vaccines keep cancer in check" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

But as the mudflats are filled in and developed&#8212;because of&#160;dams, rising sea levels, and the construction of sea walls&#8212;the <a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2017/170413/ncomms14895/full/ncomms14895.html">birds most dependent on this stopover are declining, in some cases by as much as 8% per year</a>, researchers report today in <cite>Nature Communications</cite>. Biologists analyzed data collected by citizen scientists between 1993 and 2012 about the numbers of 10 bird species that reach New Zealand and Australia. The numbers in species such as the gray-tailed tattler that don&#8217;t rely heavily on the mudflats remained about stable over that time, they discovered. But for the seven species of&#160;which at least 60% need to make this pit stop, numbers declined. Those species in trouble include the eastern curlew (see photo), the curlew sandpiper, and the great knot. In contrast, the analysis found that total migration distance, body size, nonbreeding grounds location, and other factors have not contributed to this decline. Given the critical importance of these stopovers, the researchers call for greater international efforts to slow the mudflat loss. Already, 36 governments and other organizations have formed the <a href="http://www.eaaflyway.net/http:/www.eaaflyway.net/">East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership</a>, but they may not be able to act in time to save these birds, the researchers note.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Migrating shorebirds in danger, due to disappearing mudflats" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

When top researchers in Eastern Europe started joining high-power institutions in the West, the research suggests, their colleagues and students back home ended up with fewer cross-border connections. "I\'m quite surprised how big the effect is," says Paul Nightingale, a science policy expert at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who was not involved in the study. "These are worrying findings."</p>\n\n<p>The analysis is based on a natural experiment. In 2004, the European Union expanded by adding 10 member states, including Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. This made it much easier for people in these countries to find work and live in Western Europe. By tapping a government database on intra-European job moves, Alexander Petersen, a computational social scientist at the University of California, Merced, and his colleagues were able to infer the impact of the union\'s expansion on scientific mobility. The database records the international transfers of highly skilled workers, such as doctors and civil engineers, who need a professional certification in a new host country.</p>\n\n<p>It was easy to see the brain drain. Although most professionals hopped between neighboring countries, the percentage that left Eastern for Western Europe rose from 5% to 29% after 2005. Scientists aren\'t in the database, because they don\'t need government accreditation, but Petersen thinks the trend is likely the same. Other experts agree: "There is a lot of migration because of the high-quality infrastructure in universities in the West," says Peter Tindemans, secretary-general of EuroScience, a membership association of European researchers, based in Strasbourg, France. "Scientists gravitate to the places where they can do the best science." He says there is a similar pattern with European Research Council grants, which researchers can take along when they head to a new institution.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>To find out what happens when a researcher packs up for a new country, Petersen and his colleagues dug into a database of millions of scientific papers published between 1996 and 2012, looking at affiliations of the authors as a proxy for international research collaborations. After 2004,&#160;<a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/4/e1602232">the new member nations in the east experienced a drop in the proportion of papers published with international co-authors</a>&#160;(see chart), the team reports in the current issue of&#160;<cite>Science Advances</cite>.&#160;In contrast, this ratio increased in the older member nations. (Here\'s how the ratio was calculated: Papers were counted as an international publication in each country where a co-author was located. A paper with authors only from a single country was counted as a noninternational publication in that country.) In Poland, for example, the ratio of internationally co-authored papers fell from 33% in 2004 to 28% in 2011, whereas it rose from 28% to 43% in the United Kingdom.</p>\n  \n  <div class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-image align-right">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/Cosmopolitan_talent_Western_Europe_Eastern_Europe_chartbuilder.png?itok=ryPQYTLF" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/Cosmopolitan_talent_Western_Europe_Eastern_Europe_chartbuilder.png?itok=ryPQYTLF 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/Cosmopolitan_talent_Western_Europe_Eastern_Europe_chartbuilder.png?itok=9UHf77sl 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption">\n  \n      <p>Countries within Western Europe are publishing a higher proportion of papers with foreign co-authors, partly because new talent immigrated from Eastern Europe and brought existing networks of international collaborators.</p>\n  \n</div>\n      <div class="credit"></div>\n    </figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n  \n  \n      <p>What likely happened is "rather intuitive," the researchers write in their paper. When top scientists in Eastern Europe moved to institutions in Western Europe, they brought along their connections with scientists in other countries&#8212;say, a Hungarian molecular biologist with ongoing collaborations in France and Germany, who moves to the United Kingdom. "Good scientists tend to collaborate with other scientists abroad," says co-author Fabio Pammolli, an economist at the Polytechnic University of Milan in Italy. "This is part of the increasing integration of science." In addition, he notes, talented graduate students came to study in Western universities and built new contacts while working in internationally staffed labs. Meanwhile, their home countries had lost international connections.</p>\n\n<p>This migration and concentration of talent in research hubs is a natural part of scientific growth, the authors say. At the same time, they acknowledge that losing talent is bad for the home country. The tricky balance for policymakers is that the European Union wants its most gifted scientists to be able to chase opportunities and work in the best places, but it also wants equitable growth and development among its member nations&#8212;and having a strong science base is a proven part of economic development. "It\'s one of these traditional European problems," Tindemans says. "We will not find a clear answer."</p>\n\n<p>The European Union has tried to level the economic playing field by providing billions of euros as so-called Structural Funds to its less developed member nations. In the beginning, many funds were not spent well, Tindemans says, and the European Commission has since pushed for better accounting and for more of the funds to be invested in science and innovation. "If you spend it wisely, you could do great things with that money," Tindemans says, pointing to <a href="http://www.esfri.eu/success-stories/extreme-light-infrastructure-when-scientific-excellence-contributes-europe%E2%80%99s">new high-power laser facilities in Eastern Europe</a> that are being built largely with Structural Funds. But he says it will continue to be difficult for Eastern nations to compete with the advanced centers of research elsewhere. "It\'s impossible that you will have the same high-quality research universities all over Europe. There are too few people and not enough money."&#160;</p>\n\n<p>What is needed in the short term, the authors say, is more incentives for scientific talent to return to Eastern Europe after training and experience in the West. Petersen says the commission already has valuable programs that match scientists in Eastern Europe with Western institutions to build expertise, and fellowship programs for scientific mobility, such as the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/about/individual-fellowships_en">Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie actions</a>, include a &#160;mandatory 1-year return period.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Europe&#8217;s paradox: Why increased scientific mobility has not led to more international collaborations" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Every day these hunters raid termite nests to keep their colonies fed. But the ants have chosen a dangerous prey, and tussles with large soldier termites often lead to injury&#8212;limbs and antennae are sometimes lost on the battlefield. When researchers noticed that large ants called &#8220;majors&#8221; would pick up fallen soldiers and carry the live ones back to their nests, they decided to study the fate of the injured by marking them with paint. <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/4/e1602187">More than 90% of hurt ants recovered</a> to emerge from their nests and march again in future raids, the researchers report today in <cite>Science Advances</cite>. A secretion from an injured ant&#8217;s mandibles seemed to be the key to calling for help; even when perfectly healthy ants were doused in the chemical, majors came around to offer a free ride. But if no help came for an ant in need&#8212;too slow to keep up with its departing unit&#8212;that ant was almost a third more likely to get eaten by a predator or die of exhaustion on the way home. The number of ants needing rescue each day was roughly equal to the number of ants born, meaning rescues&#8212;and the distress pheromone that signals them&#8212;help colonies stay strong enough to fight another day.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Watch these ants rescue injured comrades from termite battles" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Adults from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean swim to the Sargasso Sea to reproduce, and their offspring take a few years to return the 6000 kilometers to their respective coastlines. How they get there has been an enduring mystery. Many biologists have assumed these newborns drift aimlessly until swept up into the Gulf Stream, but like a few other marine creatures, they may actually use Earth&#8217;s magnetic field to guide their course, marine biologists have now discovered.</p>\n\n<p>Some researchers question whether this sixth sense exists in the very youngest eels found in the Sargasso Sea, but if it does, &#8220;this study adds to the growing body of evidence that the magnetic sense may be an important component of fishes that make long migrations in the ocean,&#8221; says Michael Miller, an eel biologist at Nihon University in Fujisawa, Japan, who was not involved in the work. And if it holds up that newborn eels do more than drift aimlessly, the study&#160;paints a new picture: These&#160;young eels&#160;&#8220;may be the ultimate swimming machines,&#8221; he adds.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, researchers have found that a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/06/maverick-scientist-thinks-he-has-discovered-magnetic-sixth-sense-humans">magnetic sixth sense</a> exists, perhaps even in people, and is important in <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/02/scienceshot-chinook-salmon-navigate-gpshttp:/www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/02/scienceshot-chinook-salmon-navigate-gps">salmon</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2004/04/magnetic-maps-guide-migrating-turtles">sea turtle</a>, and <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/07/big-magnet-small-fish">trout</a> migrations. And some work indicates that adult eels also sense magnetic fields. But proving the same was true of juvenile eels was quite tricky, as these fish can be quite erratic in their behavior. That makes it hard to discern any patterns in their orientation, and thus they are difficult to test.</p>\n\n<p>To better quantify whether eels did tend to swim in a particular direction in response to a magnetic field, Lewis Naisbett-Jones, a marine biologist at University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, and Nathan Putman, a marine biologist from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory at the University of Miami in Florida, designed a 25-centimeter-wide underwater arena: a central chamber connected to a dozen outer sections, each representing 30&#176; on a compass. They tested so-called glass eels, which is what the juvenile eels transform into when they arrive in Europe. A movable wall kept the eel in the center until the magnetic field was turned on and testing began.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers simulated magnetic fields from different parts of the migration route, and the fish responded as if they knew where they were going. <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)30284-1">In the magnetic field that was the same as in the Sargasso Sea, most of the eels headed southwest</a>, showing they did head in a particular direction in response to the magnetic field. In the test using the magnetic field found in the Atlantic off North America, the eels turned northeast, showing that slightly different magnetic fields caused them to orient in a different way, the researchers report today in <cite>Current Biology</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We were not surprised to find eels have a magnetic map, but we were surprised to discover how well they can detect subtle differences in magnetic fields&#8221; Naisbett-Jones says.</p>\n\n<p>At first, the orientations were confusing&#8212;the eels weren\'t headed the most direct way home. Yet a computer model showed that the headings taken by the juvenile eels in the experiment would in fact make their migration more efficient, as they got the fish into the Gulf Stream faster and kept them in this current so that they headed to Europe.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Swimming the \'wrong\' direction for a bit gets them into the Antilles Current, which connects them to the Gulf Stream,&#8221; Putman explains. &#8220;So, with a little bit of work they can get a mostly free ride to Europe.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The oceanographic model "strengthens the overall findings,&#8221; says Miguel Baltazar-Soares, a marine biologist at Bournemouth University in Poole, U.K., who was not involved with the work.</p>\n\n<p>However, the study has a major flaw, several experts say. Eels undergo several major transformations. Newborns are not very eellike at all, being more like flattened gelatinous ribbons than rounded elongated fish, so it&#8217;s not clear that these newborns would have the same sensory capabilities of the juveniles tested, says Caroline Durif, a marine biologist at the Institute of Marine Research in Bergen, Norway. &#8220;I would also like to point out that none of the authors are recognized eel experts&#8212;the paper&#8217;s main authors have not focused on eels before in their research. Otherwise, they would have realized how absurd this study is.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>But Putman doesn&#8217;t think the use of older eels is a problem and assumes even newborns have this magnetic sense. Instead, he thinks that the novelty of finding a magnetic compass in eels &#8220;might rub some people the wrong way&#8221; because they had not discovered it before.</p>\n\n<p>Next, he hopes to demonstrate that adult eels also use magnetism to find their way to the Sargasso Sea.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Young European eels may use magnetic fields to guide them home" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Because such chemistry provides energy for microbial life on Earth, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/155">the discovery makes Enceladus the top candidate for hosting life elsewhere in the solar system</a>&#8212;besting even Jupiter&#8217;s Europa, another icy moon with an ocean. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t see microbes,&#8221; says Hunter Waite, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, and the lead author of a study published this week in <em>Science</em>. &#8220;But we saw their food.&#8221;</p>\n  \n  <figure class="figure__minimal entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-related-articles align-right"><article class="media media--var media--priority-2"><div class="media__icon">\n        \n  \n      <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/missions-last-hurrah-cassini-aims-solve-riddle-saturns-rings"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.sciencemag.org//www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/grid_thumb_-_290x163__16_9_/public/ca_0414NID_Cassini_Path_1280x720.jpg?itok=PbjRTulf" alt="An artist\'s conception of Cassini\'s orbit"></a>  \n      </div>\n    \n    <div class="media__body">\n              <h3 class="overline"></h3>\n      \n\n      \n      <h2 class="media__headline">\n        <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/missions-last-hurrah-cassini-aims-solve-riddle-saturns-rings">In mission\'s last hurrah, Cassini aims to solve riddle of Saturn\'s rings</a>\n      </h2>\n          </div>\n  </article></figure><p>In previous passes through the plumes, the Cassini team found organic molecules like methane and formaldehyde. A final pass in October 2015, just 48 kilometers above the surface, revealed something even more tantalizing: abundant hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>). The authors argue that it comes from hydrothermal activity on the ocean floor, perhaps seafloor vents like those on Earth that spew H<sub>2</sub>&#160;and support rich microbial life. It could be produced by water reacting with iron, or similar reactions baking out primitive organic molecules trapped in the rocky core.</p>\n\n<p>Waite and his colleagues were previously blind to hydrogen in the plumes because of surges of it created in their own instrument when water reacted with its titanium components. All the potential biases seem accounted for now, says Gabriel Tobie, a planetary scientist at the University of Nantes in France who was unaffiliated with the study. The high volume of hydrogen is a puzzle, as are spikes in its abundance, but it is not the only evidence of seafloor activity on Enceladus. In 2015, Cassini scientists studied particles from Saturn&#8217;s E ring, known to be fed by Enceladus&#8217;s plumes, and found tiny glass beads that could have only come from hydrothermal reactions. &#8220;These converging pieces of evidence tell us that something special is happening inside Enceladus,&#8221; Tobie says.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, NASA is pinning its hopes for life on Europa, with the $2 billion Europa Clipper planned for launch in the next decade. The Hubble telescope has seen signs of a plume on Europa erupting twice from the same spot, according to a study in this week&#8217;s issue of&#160;<em>The Astrophysical Journal</em>. But the signal is contested, and there&#8217;s no evidence yet of hydrothermal activity.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to second guess targets at all,&#8221; says Waite, who leads an instrument on the Clipper. But he thinks Enceladus is just begging to be sampled with a mission designed for the task.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Food for microbes abundant on Enceladus" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Consider gentoo penguins (<em>Pygoscelius papua</em>), which have a major breeding colony (image) on Ardley Island off the Antarctic peninsula. The orange-billed birds first appeared on the island about 6700 years ago, and previous studies indicate that the climate and sea surface temperatures in the region have been good to them thus far. But sediment cores drilled from a 7300-square-meter lake on the island&#8212;which today collects runoff that includes prodigious amounts of penguin guano as well as material eroded from the island&#8217;s bedrock&#8212;tell a different story. At three times since the birds arrived, major eruptions of a volcano on Deception Island, which lies about 120 kilometers away, have <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms14914">cloaked Ardley Island with centimeters-thick layers of ash</a> that later washed into the lake, the researchers report in <cite>Nature Communications</cite>. It&#8217;s not clear whether each of those ash layers chronicles a single large eruption or a closely spaced sequence of smaller ones. Regardless, guano-free followed by guano-poor sediments left in the wake of these three eruptions suggest that breeding penguins were wiped out&#8212;or abandoned the island for posteruption intervals ranging between 400 and 800 years. Thick layers of ash would have made it hard for the birds to breathe, compromised the immune systems of adult and hatchling penguins, and may have prevented adults from collecting pebbles that they needed to construct their nests, the researchers suggest.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Volcanic eruptions may have periodically wiped out Antarctic penguin colonies" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Hiring by algorithm would give men and women an equal chance at work, the thinking goes, and predicting criminal behavior with big data would sidestep racial prejudice in policing. But a new study shows that computers can be biased as well, especially when they learn from us. When algorithms glean the meaning of words by gobbling up lots of human-written text, they adopt stereotypes very similar to our own.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think that AI is some fairy godmother,&#8221; says study co-author Joanna Bryson, a computer scientist at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom and Princeton University. &#8220;AI is just an extension of our existing culture.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The work was inspired by a psychological tool called the implicit association test, or IAT. In the IAT, words flash on a computer screen, and the speed at which people react to them indicates subconscious associations. Both black and white Americans, for example, are faster at associating names like &#8220;Brad&#8221; and &#8220;Courtney&#8221; with words like &#8220;happy&#8221; and &#8220;sunrise,&#8221; and names like &#8220;Leroy&#8221; and &#8220;Latisha&#8221; with words like &#8220;hatred&#8221; and &#8220;vomit&#8221; than vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>To test for similar bias in the &#8220;minds&#8221; of machines, Bryson and colleagues developed a word-embedding association test (WEAT). They started with an established set of &#8220;word embeddings,&#8221; basically a computer&#8217;s definition of a word, based on the contexts in which the word usually appears. So &#8220;ice&#8221; and &#8220;steam&#8221; have similar embeddings, because both often appear within a few words of &#8220;water&#8221; and rarely with, say, &#8220;fashion.&#8221; But to a computer an embedding is represented as a string of numbers, not a definition that humans can intuitively understand. Researchers at Stanford University generated the embeddings used in the current paper <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1162">by analyzing hundreds of billions of words on the internet</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of measuring human reaction time, the WEAT computes the similarity between those strings of numbers. Using it, Bryson&#8217;s team found that the embeddings for names like &#8220;Brett&#8221; and &#8220;Allison&#8221; were more similar to those for positive words including love and laughter, and those for names like &#8220;Alonzo&#8221; and &#8220;Shaniqua&#8221; were more similar to negative words like &#8220;cancer&#8221; and &#8220;failure.&#8221; To the computer, bias was baked into the words.</p>\n\n<p>IATs have also shown that, on average, Americans associate men with work, math, and science, and women with family and the arts. And young people are generally considered more pleasant than old people. All of these associations were found with the WEAT. The program also inferred that flowers were more pleasant than insects and musical instruments were more pleasant than weapons, using the same technique to measure the similarity of their embeddings to those of positive and negative words.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers then developed a word-embedding factual association test, or WEFAT. The test determines how strongly words are associated with other words, and then compares the strength of those associations to facts in the real world. For example, it looked at how closely related the embeddings for words like &#8220;hygienist&#8221; and &#8220;librarian&#8221; were to those of words like &#8220;female&#8221; and &#8220;woman.&#8221; For each profession, it then compared this computer-generated gender association measure to the actual percentage of women in that occupation. The results were very highly correlated. So embeddings can encode everything from common sentiments about flowers to racial and gender biases and <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/183">even facts about the labor force</a>, the team reports today in <cite>Science</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of cool that these algorithms discovered these,&#8221; says Tolga Bolukbasi, a computer scientist at Boston University who concurrently conducted <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6228-man-is-to-computer-programmer-as-woman-is-to-homemaker-debiasing-word-embeddings">similar work with similar results</a>. &#8220;When you&#8217;re training these word embeddings, you never actually specify these labels.&#8221; What&#8217;s not cool is how prejudiced embeddings might be deployed&#8212;when sorting r&#233;sum&#233;s or loan applications, say. For example, if a computer searching r&#233;sum&#233;s for computer programmers associates &#8220;programmer&#8221; with men, mens&#8217; r&#233;sum&#233;s will pop to the top. Bolukbasi\'s work focuses on ways to &#8220;debias&#8221; embeddings&#8212;that is, removing unwanted associations from them.</p>\n\n<p>Bryson has another take. Instead of debiasing embeddings, essentially throwing away information, she prefers adding an extra layer of human or computer judgement to decide how or whether to act on such biases. In the case of hiring programmers, you might decide to set gender quotas.</p>\n\n<p>People have long suggested that meaning could plausibly be extracted through word cooccurrences, &#8220;but it was a far from a foregone conclusion,&#8221; says Anthony Greenwald, a psychologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who developed the IAT in 1998 and wrote a <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/133">commentary</a> on the WEAT paper for this week&#8217;s issue of <cite>Science</cite>. He says he expected that writing&#8212;the basis of the WEAT measurements&#8212;would better reflect explicit attitudes than implicit biases. But instead, the WEAT embeddings more closely resemble IAT biases than surveys about racial and gender attitudes, suggesting that we may convey prejudice through language in ways we don&#8217;t realize. &#8220;That was a bit surprising,&#8221; he says. He also says the WEAT might be used to test for implicit bias in past eras by testing word embeddings derived from, say, books written in the 1800s.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, Byron and her colleagues have also shown that even Google is not immune to bias. The company&#8217;s translation software converts gender-neutral pronouns from several languages into &#8220;he&#8221; when talking about a doctor, and &#8220;she&#8221; when talking about a nurse.</p>\n\n<p>All of this work &#8220;shows that it is important how you choose your words,&#8221; Bryson says. &#8220;To me, this is actually a vindication of political correctness and affirmative action and all these things. Now, I see how important it is.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Even artificial intelligence can acquire biases against race and gender" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

The question has been as difficult to answer as it has been controversial. Now, the largest brain-imaging study of its kind indeed finds some sex-specific patterns, but overall more similarities than differences. The work raises new questions about how brain differences between the sexes may influence intelligence and behavior.</p>\n\n<p>For decades, brain scientists have noticed that on average, male brains tend to have slightly higher total brain volume than female ones, even when corrected for males&#8217; larger average body size. But it has proved&#160;notoriously tricky to pin down exactly which substructures within the brain are more or less voluminous. Most studies have looked at relatively small sample sizes&#8212;typically fewer than 100 brains&#8212;making large-scale conclusions impossible.</p>\n\n<p>In the new study, a team of researchers led by psychologist Stuart Ritchie, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Edinburgh, turned to data from <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/uk-begins-worlds-largest-biomedical-imaging-study">UK Biobank</a>, an ongoing, long-term biomedical study of people living in the United Kingdom with 500,000 enrollees. A subset of those enrolled in the study underwent brain scans using MRI. In 2750 women and 2466 men aged 44&#8211;77, Ritchie and his colleagues examined the volumes of 68 regions within the brain, as well as the thickness of the cerebral cortex, the brain&#8217;s wrinkly outer layer thought to be important in consciousness, language, memory, perception, and other functions.</p>\n\n<p>Adjusting for age, on average, they found that women tended to have significantly thicker cortices than men. Thicker cortices have been associated with higher scores on a variety of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678742/">cognitive</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3985090/">general intelligence</a> tests. Meanwhile, men&#160;had higher brain volumes than women&#160;in every subcortical region they looked at, including the hippocampus (which plays broad roles in memory and spatial awareness), the amygdala (emotions, memory, and decision-making), striatum (learning, inhibition, and reward-processing), and thalamus (processing and relaying sensory information to other parts of the brain).</p>\n\n<p>When the researchers adjusted the numbers to look at the subcortical regions relative to overall brain size, the comparisons became much closer: There were only 14 regions where men had higher brain volume and 10 regions where women did.</p>\n\n<p>Volumes and cortical thickness between <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/04/123729">men&#160;also tended to vary much more than they did between women</a>, the researchers report this month in a paper posted to the bioRxiv server, which makes articles available before they have been peer reviewed.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s intriguing because it lines up with previous work looking at <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00096.x">sex and IQ tests</a>. &#8220;[That previous study] finds no average difference in intelligence, but males were more variable than females,&#8221; Ritchie says. &#8220;This is why our finding that male participants&#8217; brains were, in most measures, more variable than female participants&#8217; brains is so interesting. It fits with a lot of other evidence that seems to point toward males being more variable physically and mentally.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Despite the study&#8217;s consistent sex-linked patterns, the researchers also found considerable overlap between men and women in brain volume and cortical thickness, just as you might find in height.&#160;In other words, just by looking at the brain scan, or height, of someone plucked at random from the study, researchers would be hard pressed to say whether it came from a man or woman. That suggests both sexes&#8217; brains are far more similar than they are different.</p>\n\n<p>The study didn&#8217;t account for whether participants&#8217; gender matched their biological designation as male or female.</p>\n\n<p>The study&#8217;s sheer size makes the results convincing, writes Amber Ruigrok, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom who has studied sex differences in the brain, in an email to <cite>Science</cite>. &#8220;Larger overall volumes in males and higher cortical thickness in females fits with findings from previous research. But since previous research mostly used relatively small sample sizes, this study confirms these predictions.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Ruigrok notes one factor that should be addressed in future studies: menopause. Many of the women in the study were in the age range of the stages of menopause, and hormonal fluctuations have been shown to influence brain structures. That may have played some role in the sex differences noted in the study, she says.</p>\n\n<p>The controversial&#8212;and still unsettled&#8212;question is whether these patterns mean anything to intelligence or behavior. Though popular culture is replete with supposed examples of intellectual and behavioral differences between the sexes, only a few, like higher physical aggression in men, have been borne out by scientific research.</p>\n\n<p>For the moment, Ritchie says his work isn&#8217;t equipped to answer such heady questions: He is focused on accurately describing the differences in the male and female brain, not speculating on what they could mean.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Study finds some significant differences in brains of men and women" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

The report&#8217;s key recommendation is that universities and scientific societies create, operate, and fund a new, independent, nongovernmental Research Integrity Advisory Board (RIAB). The board would serve as a clearinghouse to raise awareness of the issues, as an honest broker to mediate disagreements, and as a beacon to help institutions that lack the knowledge or resources to root out bad behavior and foster good behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Other entities are already doing these things, but none has research integrity as its sole focus nor covers so much territory. Federal funding agencies investigate and punish miscreants who misuse taxpayer dollars, universities train scientists as part of their mission to advance knowledge, and scientific societies and journals have adopted ethical standards for their authors and members. After reviewing that landscape, the committee concluded that all of those organizations need to step up their game.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t think the system is broken, but we think there is a lot more we as a community can do,&#8221; says Robert Nerem, professor emeritus of bioengineering at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta and chair of <a href="http://www8.nationalacademies.org/cp/projectview.aspx?key=49387">the committee that wrote the report.</a></p>\n\n<p>And Nerem doesn&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any time to waste. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t do better, Congress could step in&#8221; and act unilaterally, he warns. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t think Congress [would have] the best interests of the research enterprise at heart in moving forward. Some legislators are champions of research, but I would be leery of what would come out of Congress.&#8221;</p>\n\n<h2>A long, hard slog</h2>\n\n<p>The committee began its work in 2012 with the goal of updating a 1992 National Academies&#160;report, <em><a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/1864/responsible-science-volume-i-ensuring-the-integrity-of-the-research">Responsible Science</a></em>, which made a similar pitch for an advisory body. (It went unheeded.)&#160;The 1992 report was prompted by a wave of research misconduct cases that soiled science&#8217;s reputation and led to the creation of the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) to investigate misconduct involving federally funded biomedical research.</p>\n\n<p>But what began as a 2-year project wound up taking quite a bit longer. &#8220;The research enterprise has grown a lot in the past 25 years,&#8221; Nerem says, adding that the rise in interdisciplinary research, new technologies, concerns about reproducibility, and increased international collaboration have made research integrity a much more complex issue. The committee almost&#160;ran out of money at one point, and the exhaustive internal vetting process given every Academies&#160;report took even longer than usual.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the widespread adoption of ethical standards by the scientific community, research misconduct continues to be a thorn in the side of the scientific community. ORI and its counterpart at the National Science Foundation (NSF) receive hundreds of allegations every year, which result in dozens of findings of misconduct.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than hiding its head in the sand, the committee decided that self-examination might help the community do its job better. An appendix to its report includes five notorious cases, including one several years ago at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/11/potti-found-guilty-research-misconduct">involving fabrication by cancer researcher Anil Potti</a>, in which Nerem says the school&#8217;s response to allegations of misconduct was as flawed as the behavior itself. &#8220;As good a research institution as Duke is, clearly, they fell down on the job,&#8221; Nerem says.</p>\n\n<p>Although ORI concluded the Potti investigation in 2015, Nerem says he&#8217;s not convinced the institution has learned its lesson. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if Duke has changed its practices, but it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if it happened again,&#8221; he says. &#8220;After all, people are only human.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The best way to reduce the number of such ugly incidents, Nerem believes, is for top university officials to make clear that training in the responsible conduct of research (RCR) is a priority at their institution. And that&#8217;s where the proposed advisory board could help.</p>\n\n<p>A creation of the community, the RIAB would &#8220;have no direct role in investigations, regulation, or accreditation,&#8221; the report says. Nor would it set enforceable standards for the profession. But Nerem and others believe that the board&#8217;s focus on fostering ethical behavior could encourage institutions to pay more attention to the issue.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="graphic entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-figure"><h3 class="graphic__header">Less than the best</h3>\n  <div class="graphic__body">\n<p>A new review of 91 universities found that few require more than an online course for research ethics training.</p>\n</div>\n\n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/gg_SVG_RIR_4%20%281%29.png?itok=C4jaQ9Er" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/gg_SVG_RIR_4%20%281%29.png?itok=C4jaQ9Er 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/gg_SVG_RIR_4%20%281%29.png?itok=o4IdlsWA 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption"></div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      CREDITS: (GRAPHIC) G.

(and former&#160;<cite>Science</cite>&#160;editor-in-chief), thinks the board could be especially helpful to small institutions. &#8220;I see it as the great equalizer,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Big research organizations are well-oiled machines, but a smaller organization may not know how to proceed with an investigation or create an RCR training program.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Another way to improve the quality of investigations would be to subject them to external peer review. &#8220;We do it for journal articles, and for grant proposals, so why not use outside experts on investigations as well?&#8221; Nerem asks.</p>\n\n<p>The committee looked at various mechanisms for establishing the board and decided that it should sit outside the federal umbrella. &#8220;Most universities feel they are already being micromanaged by the government, and having this board be part of [the federal bureaucracy] might reinforce that,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n<p>McNutt sees another reason for its independence. &#8220;The federal government has been slow to adopt best practices on research integrity,&#8221; she says. &#8220;So I&#8217;m not surprised that the committee feels that it would be better for the board to be independent.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The makeup and location of the board would be up to its founding members, who would also finance its operations. The panel proposed that the board have an annual budget of $3 million, with the money coming from federal agencies, foundations, and universities. Academic institutions would pay dues on a sliding scale based on how much research they perform.</p>\n\n<p>McNutt says that the National Academies might consider a request to provide physical space for the board but that otherwise her organization would remain at arm&#8217;s length. That would also allow the Academies to carry out an independent evaluation of the board&#8217;s activities if it were asked to do so, she adds.&#160;</p>\n\n<h2>More than a checklist</h2>\n\n<p>Coincidentally, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-017-9883-5">a new study in <em>Science and Engineering Ethics</em></a> highlights some gaps in training that the board might address. In 2007, Congress ordered NSF&#160;to require every grant application to include a plan for RCR training of all postdoctoral researchers, undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers who would be participating in the proposed research. But the study finds that most universities have adopted bare bones programs that appear tailored to simply comply with the requirement rather than to truly educate the next generation of scientists by following best practices in the field. Most consist of online instruction rather than face-to-face interaction (see graph, above), deliver a single &#8220;dose&#8221; rather than ongoing ethics training, and take a one-size-fits-all approach that doesn&#8217;t differentiate by discipline or the student&#8217;s academic status.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;If you think of [RCR] as compliance, you&#8217;re missing the boat,&#8221; says medical ethicist Elizabeth Heitman of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, a co-author of the study. &#8220;The problem is that it&#8217;s become a checklist.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The authors suggest that NSF also shoulders some responsibility for the current situation. NSF doesn&#8217;t require institutions to document that they are actually providing the training, giving them broad latitude to design their programs. Nor does NSF do any systematic monitoring of those efforts. In response, an agency spokesperson says that &#8220;NSF believes that &#8230; education in [RCR] is essential in the preparation of future scientists and engineers.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Heitman believes the fundamental problem is that many universities view ethics training as an add-on rather than as part of their core mission. That leads to a cascade of poor practices, she says, including leaving the training to others, doing it on the cheap, and dropping it when a funding agency no longer requires it to win a grant. &#8220;We don&#8217;t outsource biostatistics or biochemistry education, but we think differently about ethics and research integrity,&#8221; she laments.&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n<p>The impact of federal research policies on research integrity could be another ripe area for the new board to examine, notes the Academies&#160;report. Increasing competition for funding and the need for high-profile publications in order to win academic promotion can generate &#8220;detrimental research practices&#8221; that fall short of the federal definition of misconduct as fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism but nevertheless stray from acceptable norms.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The ultimate goal of the board,&#8221; says McNutt, &#8220;would be to create a climate in which we never have to investigate research misconduct because it never occurs.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="U.S. report calls for research integrity board" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

In a lecture hall buzzing with excitement, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and the Spanish government yesterday presented a plan to open a new lab here for the study of tissues and organs. The center, EMBL\'s first new outpost in 18 years, will host six to eight research groups; a director has yet to be named but recruitment has begun.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement is welcome news to the Spanish scientific community, which has suffered from years of budget cuts and political neglect. The agreement also strengthens Barcelona\'s profile as one of southern Europe\'s premier science hubs, adds Joan Guinovart, director of the Institute for Research in Biomedicine here. &#8220;Barcelona is already one of the hottest spots in biomedicine in Europe," he says.</p>\n\n<p>Headquartered in Heidelberg, Germany, EMBL is an international organization supported by 22 member states; it\'s not affiliated with the European Union. Over the decades, EMBL has established specialized franchises for structural biology in Hamburg, Germany, and Grenoble, France; for bioinformatics in Hinxton, U.K.; and finally, in 1999, for mouse biology in Monterotondo, Italy. The new branch, housed at the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park (PRBB), will study how cells organize and interact at the tissue level. &#8220;For a long time, tissue was not possible to study with molecular biology; now it is becoming possible, thanks to the development of new imaging techniques,&#8221; Jan Ellenberg, the head of EMBL\'s Cell Biology &amp; Biophysics Unit, said during yesterday\'s ceremony.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p class="Science">In 2006, EMBL established a joint research unit at PRBB with Barcelona\'s Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), led by current CRG director and former EMBL department head Luis Serrano. The partnership combined computational biology with genomics and proteomics to tackle complex systems biology problems. &#8220;The quality of the work that was done here was outstanding,&#8221; EMBL Director-General Iain Mattaj tells <em>Science</em>Insider. That helped convince EMBL\'s other member states to establish a fully fledged lab here, he says, as did the presence of strong universities, research institutes, and a hospital.</p>\n\n<p class="Science">EMBL will invest &#8364;16 million in the new site during the first 5 years. Spain, which contributes about &#8364;9 million annually to EMBL&#8212;8.5% of the organization\'s total budget&#8212;has put an additional &#8364;6 million on the table until 2021. The Catalan government will foot the &#8364;400,000 annual bill for rent and maintenance.</p>\n\n<p class="Science">EMBL Barcelona will provide access to state-of-the art technologies for imaging and modelling of tissues and organs, including a facility to grow organoids, mini-versions of real organs produced in vitro. Researchers will also use computers to model diseases in organs and tissues. &#8220;This opens great opportunities scientifically,&#8221; says Serrano; &#8220;for CRG, it&#8217;s a nice way to grow critical mass&#8221; in the field, he adds. &#8220;One of the biggest frontiers in biology is trying to understand organ functioning, [both] from an intellectual and medical point of view.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="EMBL opens new lab for tissue biology and disease modeling in Barcelona" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

The approach relies on small quantities of vapor released from the common explosive TNT. Previously, researchers engineered <cite>Escherichia coli </cite>(pictured), a bacterial species abundant in the environment and in mammalian intestines, to glow green upon detection of DNT, a byproduct of TNT. In a study published in <cite>Nature Biotechnology</cite> today, the same team reports on a small field test with mines buried in sand and soil, whose triggering mechanisms were removed. The scientists loaded about 100,000 DNT-detecting bacterial cells into a single bead made of polymers derived from seaweed and sprinkled these beads over the landmine site at night. Twenty-four hours later, they used a laser to remotely detect and quantify fluorescing bacteria from 20 meters away, mapping the location of the landmines. The researchers tell <cite>Science</cite> that they have since improved their system to detect the explosives in only 3 hours and are programming the bacteria to have a limited life span to ease qualms about permanently releasing genetically engineered microbes in the environment. The team is careful to note that its trial was preliminary. For now, the technique is limited to small areas, but in the future a faster laser attached to a drone could scan larger swaths of land. The bacteria will also need to be optimized to find mines buried in rougher terrain, or ones that use explosives besides TNT.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Glowing bacteria detect buried landmines" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Geophysicists in Iceland were studying volcanic tremors&#8212;rapidly repeating mini-earthquakes thought to come from magma moving underground&#8212;when they noticed something odd. Looking at data from Hekla Volcano, they found one tremor that arose, not from the volcano, but from a passing helicopter. As their rotor blades spin, helicopters create a series of closely spaced pressure pulses that travel through the air to the ground below. These pulses appear merged as a single tremor, which can be picked up by seismometers up to 40 kilometers away, depending on topography and wind. Seismic tremors have already been recorded for other phenomena&#8212;including floods, mud flows, and icebergs&#8212;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggx048">but this is the first time they have been detected for an aircraft</a>, the researchers report in <cite>Geophysical Journal International</cite>. To explore the signals further&#8212;and ensure helicopters aren&#8217;t mistaken for volcanoes&#8212;the team recorded tremors from a helicopter flying through a network of seven seismometers. By measuring the changing frequency of the signals as the chopper passed each one, the researchers determined the approximate location, altitude, speed, and flight direction of the craft. As most choppers don&#8217;t vary rotor speed during flight, the researchers were even able to use tremor frequencies to deduce the number of rotor blades and their revolution speed. With enough information on different helicopter specs, it might be possible to determine the model of chopper, the researchers say. And though the study looked only at helicopters, in principle the new approach could also track any rotor- or propeller-based craft, including drones.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Earthquake detectors can pick up helicopters, too" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

That can&#8217;t be done with humans, but some people are natural knockouts&#8212;born missing one or more genes. Now, a look at the DNA of 10,500 Pakistanis has found more than 1300 genes that are knocked out without causing obvious medical issues. The results may help confirm why a new heart disease drug flopped in clinical trials, and why another new drug should work just fine.</p>\n\n<p>The study is the latest of several hunts for apparently healthy human knockouts that have included <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/03/one-thousand-genes-you-could-live-without">Iceland</a> and the United Kingdom. &#8220;The Human Genome Project gave us a parts list of 18,000 genes, and this project is trying to understand what missing a part means in terms of biological consequences,&#8221; says heart disease geneticist Sekar Kathiresan of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who co-led the study.</p>\n\n<p>In Pakistan, people often marry their first cousins. That raises the odds that a mother and father will both pass identical copies of a mutation in a specific gene to their children. (Unless the mutated gene is on a sex chromosome, both parental copies of a gene have to be disabled for a full knockout.) Kathiresan&#8217;s group sequenced the DNA of 10,503 Pakistanis who are participating in a long-term heart disease and diabetes study and found 1317 fully knocked-out genes. The team then looked for abnormalities in about 200 clinical blood biomarkers such as cholesterol.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature22034">Seven genes were disabled in at least two people</a> and clearly matched up with some biomarker change, such as unusually low insulin levels, the team reports today in <cite>Nature</cite>. One codes for an enzyme called Lp-PLA2 that has been linked to arterial plaque. Because higher blood levels of Lp-PLA2 correlate with more heart attacks, drug companies have already spent billions of dollars on Lp-PLA2&#8211;blocking drugs. But Pakistanis who lacked one or both copies of the gene didn&#8217;t have a lower risk of heart disease, which adds to <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160615102425.htm">other genetics studies that may explain why these drugs failed in the clinic</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the study found strong support for another heart disease drug target, a protein called ApoC-III that <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/10/why-lucky-few-can-eat-their-hearts-content">limits the body&#8217;s ability to metabolize fats called triglycerides</a>. Although Kathiresan&#8217;s team has studied people missing one copy of the <em>APCO3</em> gene, &#8220;we\'ve been looking for the past 4 years for humans who completely lack it.&#8221; They had found none in the United States and Europe, he says, but in Pakistan, his group identified a whole family where both parents and all nine of their children lack the <em>APCO3</em> gene.</p>\n\n<p>When the family members drank a fat-laden milkshake, their blood fat levels barely rose, suggesting they have little artery-clogging fat in their bodies and should be protected against heart attacks. The family also seemed perfectly healthy, so ApoC-III&#8211;blocking drugs now in clinical testing should be safe, Kathiresan predicts. The drugs could eventually join <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/03/20/what-pcsk9-is-telling-us-about-drug-discovery">another heart disease&#8211;preventing drug</a> that came out of the discovery of a healthy woman missing a gene called <em>PCSK9</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The Pakistani study is the first in which researchers tested some of the knockouts they had found to learn more about their health, says human geneticist David Van Heel of Queen Mary University of London, who last year published a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/human-knockouts-reveal-genes-we-don-t-need">smaller knockout study of British-Pakistanis</a>. Because these individuals are so rare, &#8220;we really all need to keep going to sequence more and more people,&#8221; he says. About 200,000 Pakistanis would be enough to find knockouts of about 8700 genes, Kathiresan&#8217;s team estimates. (Some of these genes are essential to early development, however, so a human knockout would never be born.)</p>\n\n<p>Kathiresan and others is now calling for a Human Knockout Project that would pool all the data coming out of these projects and other large population genetics studies in a single database. Co-author Daniel MacArthur of the Broad Institute will soon release a prototype containing knocked-out genes <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/a-radical-revision-of-human-genetics-1.20779">from a larger collection of human genomes called ExAC</a>. Eventually the plan is to make it possible for academic researchers&#8212;and drug companies&#8212;to reach out to the&#160;leaders of the original study so they can&#160;contact an individual knockout from the database and bring the person into a clinic for more testing.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Human &#8216;knockouts&#8217; may reveal why some drugs fail" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Now, for the first time, scientists have untangled why shoelace knots fail. The work also reveals the best knots to tie and could have implications for everything from surgery to new cancer drugs.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We deal with them coming untied all the time,&#8221; says Colin Adams, a mathematician at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, who was not involved with the study. &#8220;And yet, nobody&#8217;s ever taken the time to say: Why does it happen?&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s one thing we do know about shoelaces: The &#8220;square knot&#8221; holds up better than the &#8220;granny knot.&#8221; Both knots appear about the same, with two bunny-ear loops, but the granny tends to rotate to its side&#8212;one loop pointing up the shoe, the other down. (Still confused? Check out this&#160;<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/terry_moore_how_to_tie_your_shoes">TED video</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>To find out why even the best knots fail, Oliver O&#8217;Reilly, a mechanical engineer at the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues put a volunteer on a treadmill. The test subject tied her shoes with the weaker granny knot so that the researchers had a better chance of watching it unravel. The scientists attached accelerometers to her shoes to measure the acceleration, or g-force, the knot experienced with each stride.</p>\n\n<p>Using slow-motion video, the team uncovered two stages of knot&#160;slippage: a gradual loosening with each step, and a sudden &#8220;catastrophic failure.&#8221; When the knot started to unravel, it fell apart within two strides. The researchers were surprised by the g-force the knot experienced as it bobbed up and down, which was more than any rollercoaster can generate.</p>\n  \n  <div class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-image">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/shoelace_s_v_w.jpg?itok=HUfxFz3O" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/shoelace_s_v_w.jpg?itok=HUfxFz3O 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/shoelace_s_v_w.jpg?itok=9NrzMiXs 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption">\n  \n      <p>The team at the University of California,&#160;Berkeley, tested two types of knots to see which stayed tied longer.</p>\n  \n</div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      Christopher Daily-Diamond  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n  \n  \n      <p>Walking was key. The same knot that failed within 15 meters of walking stuck around if participants just stomped their feet on the ground or swung them while sitting on a table, the team reports today in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society</em>. <a href="http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rspa.2016.0770">Neither impact by itself&#8212;stomping or swinging&#8212;was enough to undo the knots</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We were able to see that these two combined effects lead to shoe knots failing,&#8221; O&#8217;Reilly says. &#8220;You need both together.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The scientists then designed an experiment to measure how long it took for knots to unravel and the rate at which the laces slipped. Working on a shoestring budget and borrowing lab equipment on weekends, the researchers designed a mechanical pendulum that smacked a plate. The pendulum&#8217;s swing approximated leg movements, and the smack the impact of shoes with the ground. The pendulum sported a shoelace with weighted ends&#8212;the added weight was needed to simulate how strongly the ends whip on runners&#8217; shoes. The team used this controlled setup to calculate the precise slip rate of shoelaces, tied either granny or square.</p>\n\n<p>The experiment confirmed the treadmill observations. Both knots initially slipped apart at a slow, gradual rate with each swing and smack of the pendulum. Eventually, though, the laces became loose enough to rapidly slip apart at a much faster rate. The study also demonstrated the superiority of the square knot. This winning knot failed about half the time (when weighted), whereas the granny knot always failed.</p>\n\n<p>But though the scientists know that one knot is more resilient, they still can&#8217;t explain why. It may have something to do with how the laces press against each other within the knot and the knot&#8217;s tension, Adams says. &#8220;If you could actually predict when a knot is going to fail,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that would have implications beyond shoelaces.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>This could include knots used in surgical sutures, on boats, and in mountaineering. But knots also exist on the microscopic level: DNA knots and unknots when it creates copies of itself, for example. Scientists are already exploiting these properties to create drugs that slow tumor growth.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Why do shoelaces untie themselves?

Somewhere along the line, the ancestor of dinosaurs diverged from the ancestor of crocodiles, a momentous split in the evolution of vertebrates that ultimately set the stage for the age of dinos. But the details of that split remain mysterious, thanks to a dearth of fossils of early dinosaur relatives. Enter the newly identified 247-million- to 242-million-year-old <em>Teleocrater rhadinus</em>, a close relative of dinosaurs that also happened to walk on all fours and share some key features with the ancestors of crocodiles. These shared features, the authors say, suggest that it&#8217;s time to rethink what we thought we knew about dinosaurs&#8217; earliest ancestors.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been waiting a long time to find fossils like this that fit in this part of the family tree,&#8221; says Randall Irmis, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum of Utah in Salt Lake City, who was not involved in the work. &#8220;This has pretty big implications for how we understand the early evolution of dinosaurs.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Some 251 million years ago, at the end of the Permian period, a mass extinction wiped out most of life on Earth. In its wake arose a group of egg-laying reptile precursors called archosaurs, the common ancestors of dinosaurs, flying reptiles known as pterosaurs, and crocodiles. At some point during the next period, the Triassic, pterosaurs and dinosaurs split off from the crocodile lineage.</p>\n\n<p>Those two different lineages, avian versus crocodilian, have long been identified by their types of ankle joints. Dinosaurs and pterosaurs all have a version of a hinged, birdlike ankle, rather than the crocodilelike ankle with ball-and-socket joint.</p>\n\n<p>But exactly what early dinosaurs and their closest relatives looked like has been something of a mystery, because few fossils exist from the dawn of the dinosaurs. And many of the fossils that do exist, collected perhaps decades to a century ago, languish unidentified in museum drawers.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, <em>Teleocrater</em> isn&#8217;t a completely new discovery. A specimen was first unearthed in what is now Tanzania in the 1930s and sat in London&#8217;s Natural History Museum until 1956, when Ph.D. candidate Alan Charig (later a paleontologist at the museum) dubbed it <em>T. rhadinus</em> (referring to the shape of the animal&#8217;s hip and its slender body). Charig, who died in 1997 but is included as an author on the new paper, speculated that it was some sort of early dinosaur relative. But the fossil was in pieces, just bits of vertebrae and pelvis and limb, and difficult to place on the family tree.</p>\n\n<p>Then in 2015, Sterling Nesbitt, a paleontologist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University&#160;in Blacksburg, and a team of researchers headed back to southern Tanzania to take another look at the middle Triassic rocks where <em>Teleocrater</em> was first discovered. This time, the rocks&#8212;estimated to be about 247 million to 242 million years old&#8212;yielded several individuals of the same species. With that new bounty, the researchers were able to catalog many more of the creature&#8217;s features&#8212;enough to place it on the vertebrate family tree.</p>\n\n<p><em>Teleocrater</em>, Nesbitt and his co-authors report online today in <cite>Nature</cite>, <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature22037">belongs at the very base of the avian lineage that later gave rise to dinosaurs</a>. It has a characteristic muscle scar on the upper leg bone that is found only in the avian lineage of birds and dinosaurs and is missing in crocodiles and their relatives. But <em>Teleocrater</em> also had a crocodilelike ankle, with a ball-and-socket joint. That suggests that the crocodile ankle came first, and the bird ankle evolved later.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s key, because the ankle joint has been used for decades as an indicator of avian versus&#160;crocodilian lineage, so <em>Teleocrater</em> must be close to the split between them. And in several respects, Nesbitt says, &#8220;<em>Teleocrater</em> looks more like the relatives of the crocodiles than the relatives of dinosaurs.&#8221; The carnivorous animal, which was roughly the size of a small lion, walked on all fours, its forelimbs and hindlimbs are similar in proportion, and the limbs themselves are pretty short relative to the length of the body.</p>\n\n<p>Seemingly small details like these can produce ripples throughout paleontology collections, because they can help researchers properly classify fossils that had seemed to be walking contradictions. &#8220;These fossils exist in museums around the world, but until you find a keystone&#8212;something that helps you understand the full anatomy [of a species]&#8212;you won&#8217;t understand where these animals go on the tree of life,&#8221; Nesbitt says.</p>\n\n<p>After identifying <em>Teleocrater</em> as an ancestor along the avian lineage, the authors could group it with several other difficult-to-place animals, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongusuchus"><em>Dongusuchus</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylosoma"><em>Spondylosoma</em></a>, naming a new group of long-necked, carnivorous quadrupeds dubbed Aphanosauria (hidden or obscure lizards, in Greek). Aphanosaurs, they suggest, are the earliest group in the avian stem lineage to diverge from the crocodile lineage. And that suggests that these bird and dinosaur ancestors were far more diverse and widely distributed across the globe during the middle Triassic than once thought.</p>\n\n<p>The find may also alter what paleontologists hunt for in the field, as well as how they understand existing collections, says Max Langer, a paleontologist at the University of S<span>&#227;</span>o Paulo in Rio Claro, Brazil. &#8220;Now that we know the diagnostic features of this group of archosaurs, everybody working on middle Triassic rocks will be looking for something similar.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Curious fossil could rewrite early days of the dinosaurs" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Fewer than 300 of these great cats remain in the forest, where they are confined to small patches of jungle surrounded by cities and farmland. So it was &#8220;the most beautiful thing in the world,&#8221; when Beatriz Beisiegel captured rare footage of a healthy female jaguar followed by her two cubs in December 2016 in Carlos Botelho State Park. The trio passed the camera trap not once, but at least three times, the last with full bellies. This is the first time that Beisiegel, a biologist with the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation in Bras&#237;lia, has seen a cub in her 12 years monitoring jaguars in the dense jungles of the Ribeira Valley, in southern S&#227;o Paulo state. The sighting is especially encouraging, given the constant threat of poaching in these encroached forests. Just last month, another jaguar was illegally shot and killed on nearby private lands by hunters who bragged about the deed in a <a href="http://g1.globo.com/sp/santos-regiao/noticia/2017/03/cacadores-matam-onca-debocham-do-animal-e-video-causa-revolta-veja.html">viral internet video</a>. Beisiegel says she hopes her videos will inspire others to protect jaguars and reject a bill currently moving through the Brazilian Congress that would legalize the sport hunting of wild animals. Appropriately enough, she has&#160;given an apt name to the female jaguar: Hope.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="This rare footage of jaguar cubs is inspiring hope for Brazil&#8217;s endangered cat" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

For sociologist Dana Fisher and a handful of other scientists who do survey research, however, the event will be another day at the office, as they plan to query those attending the demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>Fisher studies protests and climate politics. And on 22 April she will be leading a team of 16 faculty members and students from the University of Maryland in College Park who will commute to downtown Washington, D.C., to gather data from the crowd assembled on the National Mall for the flagship U.S. march. Fisher hopes that more than 500 people will complete a two-page survey asking what brought them to the event, their level of political activism, and the nature of their work.</p>\n\n<p>A different team, led by political sociologist Michael Heaney of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, also wants to explore the political identities of the marchers. Their approach will require a six-page survey, and Heaney says he&#8217;ll be ecstatic if 250 people wade through it.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>A third group wants to explore scientific norms, that is, what marchers think is appropriate political behavior by scientists. The four-person team, led by political scientist Michael Xenos of the University of Wisconsin in Madison and deployed by graduate student April Eichmeier, hopes to engage some 200 participants.</p>\n\n<p><cite>Science</cite>Insider has also identified a fourth group of researchers who hope to study the march without actually being there in person. The team, from nearby George Mason University (GMU) in Fairfax, Virginia, are asking organizers to help them recruit participants for a survey by sending out a note to the march\'s email list and social media followers.</p>\n\n<h2>Unprecedented opportunity</h2>\n\n<p>Scientists are no strangers to political activism. But the potential magnitude of this month&#8217;s marches&#8212;scheduled for hundreds of cities across the United States and around the world&#8212;may be unprecedented, says Scott Frickel, who studies mass mobilizations at Brown University and is part of Fisher&#8217;s group.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge for researchers is to understand what is driving people to act now and what their actions say about the status of science in today&#8217;s fractious political culture. &#8220;People are always upset about something,&#8221; Frickel says. &#8220;But they start movements when they see the possibility of losing what they have.&#8221; Fisher is predicting as many as 100,000 will show up at the Washington, D.C., march alone, if the weather cooperates.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers hope the data they collect will also give them a sense of what might happen next. &#8220;It&#8217;s the nature of mass mobilization,&#8221; Frickel says. &#8220;You get people in the streets, and then you figure out what you want to do.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Fisher has been doing surveys of large-scale climate protests for more than a decade. Though she specializes in environmental issues&#8212;the March for Science takes place on Earth Day&#8212;she also surveyed participants in this year&#8217;s postinaugural Women&#8217;s March on Washington.</p>\n\n<p>Her M4S instrument is based on the two-page questionnaire she used for that march. But it will contain seven additional questions&#8212;including one asking for the participant&#8217;s job title and another that requests a description of what they do at work&#8212;that are aimed at capturing the unusual demographics expected for the M4S. Although the survey is anonymous, it asks those willing to participate in a follow-up interview weeks or months later to provide contact information.</p>\n\n<p>What happens after 22 April is a less compelling question for Heaney, who studies how social movements and political party affiliation shape public policy. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure what I would make of the [follow-up] data if I asked,&#8221; he says. For Heaney, M4S offers a chance to use the science march to enrich his previous findings, such as studies showing that people tend &#8220;to abandon a movement rather than [to switch] parties.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>For example, his M4S survey asks participants to select from a list of 28 causes that might have prompted them to hit the streets at some point in their lives, from opposing the 1960s Vietnam War to Black Lives Matter and &#8220;stop Obama health care.&#8221; Fisher&#8217;s similar list of 11 topics is much shorter and asks participants to go back only a decade. It&#8217;s also more generic&#8212;the categories include peace and racial justice, for example&#8212;when dealing with the topic that prompted them to protest.</p>\n\n<p>Like his colleagues, Xenos wants to find out why people are attending the march, how they learned about it, and a bit about who they are. But he&#8217;s also interested in what they hope to accomplish, and what they think of scientists who adopt this form of political expression.</p>\n\n<h2>March madness methodologies</h2>\n\n<p>At the march, the survey takers will face the challenge of selecting participants from among the throng. All of the researchers are planning to use a variation of the standard technique for randomizing the process. Fisher&#8217;s team will plunge into the crowd and grab every fifth person, for example, whereas Heaney&#8217;s crew will start by spotting an &#8220;anchor&#8221;&#8212;a person who catches their eye for whatever reason&#8212;and then pick those who are five persons to the right and left of that individual.</p>\n\n<p>Once they find a willing subject, however, their methodology will vary. Fisher&#8217;s team will be armed with computer tablets, which they will hand over to marchers and then gently monitor their progress. It is way more efficient than using paper questionnaires, which later must be typed into computers, she says.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, Heaney will use the traditional clipboards, and Eichmeier&#8217;s crew will record the interviews, which they will later transcribe. Under survey rules approved by their university&#8217;s Institutional Review Board, the research teams won&#8217;t have to get written prior consent from their subjects because the subjects will not be identified in any way. And only those 18 and older will be asked to participate.</p>\n\n<p>Away from the march, the GMU team is taking a digital approach. Rather than in-person interviews, they are asking march organizers to help them query thousands of people who have expressed their support for the march via email&#160;or on social media. (The March for Science would not share its email or social media lists with the researchers; rather, it would let followers know the researchers are seeking their responses on a survey.)</p>\n\n<p>The GMU researchers realize that many of those people will not be scientists themselves.&#160;&#8220;The march is a unique opportunity to measure public perceptions of public engagement by scientists and the role of science in society,&#8221; says Teresa Ann Myers, a researcher at GMU&#8217;s climate change communications center that has proposed the study. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of talk about that online, but there isn&#8217;t much in the literature.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Jonathan Berman, an M4S co-chair, says the steering committee is reviewing requests from several researchers interested in contacting their supporters. &#8220;We\'re looking forward to working with social scientists who do know how to ask the right scientific questions to generate scholarly output about the march,&#8221; says Berman, a postdoc at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. Berman says that it&#8217;s unlikely any decisions will be made until after the march, however, a timeframe that Myers says &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t be a problem.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>High refusal rates are the bane of every survey researcher, and the willingness of participants to engage can vary greatly. Those attending this winter&#8217;s Women&#8217;s March on Washington were very receptive, says Fisher, with only 7.5% declining. That&#8217;s the lowest refusal rate ever for her, but she won&#8217;t be surprised if the M4S erases that record. After all, who better understands the value of doing research than a fellow researcher?</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Clarification, 4/13/2017, 11:21 a.m.:</strong> The story has been revised to clarify that the GMU researchers are not asking March for Science to share its email or social media lists with the researchers, but asking march organizers to distribute notice of a survey instrument on their behalf.</em></p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Examine thyself: Researchers set to study the March for Science" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Tapping into the knowledge of previous generations&#8212;and those around us&#8212;was long thought to be a &#8220;humans-only&#8221; trait. But homing pigeons can also build collective knowledge banks, behavioral biologists have discovered, at least when it comes to finding their way back to the roost. Like humans, the birds work together and pass on information that lets them get better and better at solving problems.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It is a really exciting development in this field,&#8221; says Christine Caldwell, a psychologist at the University of Stirling in the United Kingdom who was not involved with the work.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers have <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/146/3643/549">admired pigeon intelligence</a> for decades. Previous work has shown the birds are capable of everything from <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/207/4430/543">symbolic communication</a> to <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/12/no-joke-pigeons-ace-simple-math-test">rudimentary math</a>. They also use a wide range of cues to find their way home, including <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/01/scienceshot-homing-pigeons-follow-their-noses">smell</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/10/one-eyed-pigeons-still-use-sight-find-their-way-home">sight</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/01/sound-maps-may-help-pigeons-navigate">sound</a>, and <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/205/4410/1027">magnetism</a>. On its own, a pigeon released multiple times from the same place will even modify its navigation over time for a more optimal route home. The birds also learn specific routes from one another. Because flocks of pigeons tend to take more direct flights home than individuals, scientists have long thought some sort of &#8220;collective intelligence&#8221; is at work.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>But can pigeons improve this homing ability over generations, building on the knowledge of birds that have come before? The phenomenon, known as cumulative cultural evolution, was considered &#8220;arguably unique to humans,&#8221; says Dora Biro, a behavioral biologist at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>To find out if birds share this ability, Biro and Oxford biologist Takao Sasaki strapped GPS devices on homing pigeons and divided them into three groups: birds homing by themselves, birds flying with the same partner, and birds that switched up their partner every half dozen flights or so.</p>\n\n<p>He and Biro based their design on the famous &#8220;spaghetti tower&#8221; test. In that experiment, one person was asked to build a tower as high as possible using raw spaghetti and clay while an observer looked on. Then, the builder left and the observer was asked to build a tower in front of a new observer. Researchers found that 10 &#8220;generations&#8221; of observers each built towers similar to the ones before them, but taller, demonstrating the basic idea of standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of building towers, the pigeons simply had to fly home, an instinctive behavior. Birds in all three groups improved in the first few flights home, but after that, only the group in which the most experienced bird was periodically switched out <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms15049">continued to get closer to the perfect route</a>, the researchers report today in <em>Nature Communications</em>. The new bird in the pair was the equivalent of the observer in the spaghetti tower experiment and represented the &#8220;next generation&#8221; that learned from and built upon the experienced bird&#8217;s knowledge. &#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I think the paper convincingly shows that animal groups can show both collective intelligence and cumulative culture,&#8221; says Harvard University animal behaviorist Albert Kao, who was not affiliated with the study. A na&#239;ve bird does not develop a completely new route, but instead changes an existing route that it acquires from a bird in the previous generation&#8212;and that&#8217;s a hallmark of cumulative culture, Biro adds.</p>\n\n<p>Still, not everyone is convinced. &#8220;I like the paper. It is carefully&#8212;even beautifully&#8212;done, but I think this question of whether animals can and do have cumulative culture is still open,&#8221; says Claudio Tennie, a comparative psychologist at the University of T&#252;bingen in Germany who was not involved with the work. He argues that the pigeons are not really learning a new behavior, and thus the birds demonstrate just a subtype of cumulative culture.</p>\n\n<p>Maxime Derex, an evolutionary anthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe, agrees. Cumulative culture is more complex in humans, he says. We&#8217;ve gone from the spoken to the written word and now to ever more sophisticated electronics to communicate, he notes, whereas all the birds show is that they can improve their route home.</p>\n\n<p>Biro and Sasaki accept this difference between pigeons and humans. &#8220;But our study demonstrates that nonhuman animals can accumulate knowledge and improve performance over generations, satisfying the criteria for cumulative cultural evolution,&#8221; Sasaki says. &#8220;Thus, our results suggest that [this ability] may not require sophisticated cognition as previously thought.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Think only humans can build on the knowledge of previous generations?

Soon after that text, Weinberg and two other march enthusiasts she met online found themselves leading a global movement that has attracted millions of followers, with goals that include dramatizing concerns that political leaders are ignoring scientific evidence and demonstrating broad support for science. To turn that vision into reality, the trio has recruited scores of volunteer coordinators, negotiated partnerships with dozens of science groups, and raised some $1 million to pay for everything from security to portable toilets.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Every step of the way has been completely terrifying,&#8221; Weinberg says. &#8220;&#8216;Seems like it would be pretty easy&#8217; will be on my tombstone,&#8221; she jokes.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>March organizers admit they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;ll find at the end of their exhausting sprint. They are uncertain of how many marchers will appear, and how the demonstrations will be received. But they also are already looking past 22 April. They see march day as a beginning, not an end, as March for Science tries to pivot from being an event organizer to becoming a lasting force for science advocacy.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building an organization that is going to last beyond the march,&#8221; says Jonathan Berman, a march co-chair and a postdoctoral fellow studying hypertension at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. The goal, he says, is to create a group that can help science advocates develop the organizing and lobbying skills they need &#8220;to make their concerns heard&#8221; and &#8220;have an effect on politics.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>March organizers kept that long-term goal in mind as they shaped the Washington, D.C., event. They chose speakers who they believed would highlight the value of a vibrant and diverse scientific community. Lydia Villa-Komaroff, a Mexican-American biologist who helped demonstrate how bacteria could make insulin, will speak to the role of basic research in producing valuable discoveries. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician who helped expose dangerous lead levels in Flint, Michigan&#8217;s drinking water, symbolizes the value of science-informed advocacy. TV personality Bill Nye has become an icon of creative efforts to get young people excited about science. March planners also arranged teach-ins, including one on the science of superheroes, with the goal of getting march attendees excited about reaching out to their own communities upon returning home. And 22 April will kick off a &#8220;week of science action,&#8221; during which organizers will encourage marchers everywhere to maintain the momentum through small actions, such as posting social media messages on specific themes.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the organizers steered clear of politicians, desiring a nonpartisan atmosphere. The goal was to create &#8220;as big of a tent&#8221; as possible, says anthropologist Valorie Aquino, the third march co-chair and a Ph.D. student at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.</p>\n\n<p>March organizers are hoping for a large turnout on 22 April, but&#8212;like any good scientist&#8212;they say further evaluation will be necessary before they can draw conclusions about the event&#8217;s success. Increased advocacy from the scientific community and more science-based evidence in policy decisions could take years to come about, they concede.</p>\n\n<p>But they aren&#8217;t waiting long to take their next step. The day after the march, organizers plan to meet in Washington, D.C., with partners to discuss how March for Science can continue. Those discussions are likely to revisit many of the logistical challenges and politically sensitive issues that the group confronted over the past few months.</p>\n\n<p>Raising money, for instance, will remain a key challenge. Weinberg has dipped into her savings in order to work on the march full time. Aquino, who suspended her research to focus on the event, has been supporting herself by working as an online teaching assistant. Both would like to continue their science advocacy work through the March for Science organization. Weinberg hopes there will be just enough money leftover from march fundraising to help jump-start the group&#8217;s next steps. But funds have mostly come from individual donations and merchandise sales, which she fears will drop off after the march. (Fundraising has been complicated, she says, by vendors selling knockoff March for Science swag while falsely claiming to send proceeds to the organization.)</p>\n\n<p>The group will also have to decide how it will advocate for science without becoming too entangled in partisan politics. March critics have already noted that politically conservative scientists might not feel welcome in a group that tends to lean liberal. And others have hotly debated how the march has handled diversity issues. The organizers say that, more than aiming to advocate for a single issue, candidate, or party, they want to catalyze a cultural shift, erasing what they say many scientists see as an uncrossable line between science and advocacy. &#8220;I want scientists to get out of their comfort zone a little bit, to not leave data at someone\'s doorstep and walk away,&#8221; Aquino says.</p>\n\n<p>March organizers know they&#8217;re not the first to urge scientists to speak out&#8212;march partners AAAS (publisher of <cite>Science</cite>Insider), the Union of Concerned Scientists, and other groups have long pursued similar goals. But they note the march has roused hundreds of thousands of grassroots advocates, including nonscientists, and say that failing to follow up with them would be a lost opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;If this whole thing ended after April 22,&#8221; says Weinberg, &#8220;I would consider the last two-and-a-half months of my life kind of wasted.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="On eve of science march, planners look ahead" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Service</a><time>Apr. 19, 2017 , 1:45 PM</time></p>\n</header><p>Martin Burke is a tad envious. A chemist at the University of Illinois in Urbana, Burke has watched funding agencies back major research initiatives in other fields. Biologists pulled in billions of dollars to decipher the human genome, and physicists persuaded governments to fund the gargantuan Large Hadron Collider, which discovered the Higgs boson. Meanwhile chemists, divided among dozens of research areas, often wind up fighting for existing funds.</p>\n\n<p>Burke wants to change that. At the American Chemical Society (ACS) meeting here earlier this month, he proposed that chemists rally around an initiative to synthesize most of the hundreds of thousands of known organic natural products: the diverse small molecules made by microbes, plants, and animals. "It would be a moon mission for our field," Burke says. The effort, which would harness an automated synthesis machine he and his colleagues developed to snap together molecules from a set of premade building blocks, could cost $1 billion and take 20 years, Burke estimates. But the idea captivates at least some in the field. "Assuming it\'s a robust technology, I would have to think it would be revolutionary," says John Reed, the global head of pharma research and early development at Roche in Basel, Switzerland. "Even if it only allowed you to make half the compounds, it strikes me as worthy."</p>\n\n<p>Natural products have countless uses in modern society. They make up more than half of all medicines, as well as dyes, diagnostic probes, perfumes, sweeteners, lotions, and so on. "There\'s probably not a home on the planet that has not been impacted by natural products," Burke says.</p>\n\n<p>But discovering, isolating, and testing new natural products is slow, painstaking work. Take bryostatins, a family of 20 natural products first isolated in 1976 from spongelike marine creatures called bryozoans. Bryostatins have shown potential for treating Alzheimer\'s disease and HIV, and demand has skyrocketed. Yet chemists must mash up 14 tons of bryozoans to produce just 18 grams of bryostatin-1. Synthesizing new bryostatins is equally hard, each one requiring dozens of chemical steps.</p>\n\n<p>Burke thinks there is a better way. Two years ago, he and colleagues unveiled a machine <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6227/1190">that can link a variety of building blocks Lego-wise to create thousands of natural product compounds and their structural relatives</a>. Now he says the approach can be scaled up. Molecular biologists have already automated the synthesis of short strands of DNA, proteins, and sugar chains, revolutionizing biomedicine. Burke argues that doing the same for natural products "could have major positive implications not just for chemistry, but for society."</p>\n\n<p>Two years ago, Burke estimated that assembling 75% of natural products with his machine would take some 5000 different building blocks, compared with just four for DNA&#8212;a challenging number for chemical suppliers to make and stock. But now, Burke told the ACS meeting, the problem looks more manageable. His lab recently teamed up with that of Jeffrey Skolnick, a computational biologist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. They surveyed the literature on natural products, counted 282,487 compounds, and mapped all their structures. Skolnick\'s team then designed an algorithm to break each one into fragments, snapping only single bonds between carbon atoms&#8212;the kind of bonds Burke\'s machine can reassemble. Then the researchers asked the computer how many unique fragments it would take to reconstruct the library. It turned out that just 1400 building blocks would suffice to synthesize 75% of all natural product "chemical space," which includes related compounds not made by any organism. "This suggests it\'s a bounded, solvable problem," Burke says.</p>\n\n<p>"It\'s a profound idea," says Mukund Chorghade, president of THINQ Pharma in Mumbai, India, who believes it would be a boon for drug discovery because it could provide untold numbers of lead compounds for developing new treatments. But not everyone is sold. "Marty is a visionary," says Larry Overman, a synthetic organic chemist at the University of California, Irvine. However, he says, natural product molecules are vastly more complex in structure than biopolymers such as DNA and proteins, and whether automated synthesizers could reproduce that complexity isn\'t clear.</p>\n\n<p>An even harder problem could be securing funding for a large-scale effort to make the building blocks, assemble them into intermediate structures, and fold and tailor those to produce the final shapes. Bob Lees, head of the division at the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) in Bethesda, Maryland, that supports much of the organic chemical synthesis research in the United States, notes that in recent years NIGMS has devoted less funding to large-scale projects and more to research by single investigators. And last month, the Trump administration\'s initial budget request for 2018 proposed cutting the budget for the National Institutes of Health, the parent organization of NIGMS, by nearly 20%. Whatever its merits, Burke\'s cornucopian vision could face a steep uphill climb to become reality.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Billion-dollar project would synthesize hundreds of thousands of molecules in search of new medicines" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

A 2-year study of a population in Belgium, now entirely wiped out, has revealed that these amphibians can\'t develop immunity to the fungus, as was hoped. To make matters worse, it turns out the fungus creates a hardy spore that can survive in water for months and also stick to birds\' feet, offering a way for it to spread rapidly across the continent. Two other kinds of amphibians, both resistant to the disease, also act as carriers for the highly infectious spores.</p>\n\n<p>"This is terrible news," says geneticist Matthew Fisher of Imperial College London, who studies the fungus but was not involved in the new research. "This isn\'t a problem that\'s going to go away. It\'s a problem that\'s going to get worse."</p>\n\n<p>The pathogen, <em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em> (Bsal), is a chytrid fungus, a type that lives in damp or wet environments and typically consumes dead organic matter. Bsal infects and eats the skin of salamanders, causing lesions, apathy, loss of appetite, and eventually death. Over the past few decades, a related fungus, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5783/48"><em>B.&#160;dendrobatidis</em> (Bd), has struck hard at amphibian populations</a> around the world, particularly in the Americas, Australia, Spain, and Portugal. More than 200 species of frogs and toads are thought to have gone extinct, including many kinds of Costa Rica\'s striking stream-breeding toads.</p>\n\n<p>Bsal was identified in a nature reserve in the Netherlands in 2013 after fire salamanders started dying with ulcers and sores similar to those caused by Bd. Fire salamanders (<em>Salamandra salamandra</em>) grow up to 35 centimeters long, can live more than 40 years, and hunt insects and other small prey in forest streams. Their bright yellow spots warn predators of poison around their head and back. In the Dutch nature reserve, the population plummeted 99.9%. The fungus is thought to have arrived in Europe via salamanders or newts imported from Asia for the pet trade. Bsal has since been found in Belgium and Germany in both fire salamanders and alpine newts.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as Bsal was spotted in Belgium in April 2014, veterinarian An Martel of Ghent University&#160;in Merelbeke, Belgium, and her colleagues began visiting every month to track the population. About 90% of the fire salamanders died within 6 months, and after 2 years all were gone. The fieldwork revealed that adult animals were more likely to get infected, which makes sense because they are in closer contact with each other&#8212;through fighting for mating and breeding, for example&#8212;than are juveniles. But the death of these adults means that the population likely won\'t recover.</p>\n\n<p>There was <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature22059">no immune response detected in any of the sick animals in the lab</a>, suggesting that it will be impossible to develop a vaccine, the team reports today in <cite>Nature</cite>. "We really wanted to find solutions to mitigate disease, to save the salamanders, but everything turned out bad," Martel says. The team had also hoped that the fungus would become less virulent&#8212;as often occurs when a pathogen reaches a new host that lacks any immunity&#8212;but that hasn\'t happened: Fungal spores taken from the last fire salamanders in the Belgian forest, when dripped onto the backs of healthy salamanders in the lab, were just as lethal as those collected early in the outbreak. "When they come in contact with a single spore, they will die."</p>\n  \n  <blockquote class="pullquote">\n  \n  \n      <p>This is a very important piece of work, and it\'s terrifying. &#8230;&#160;If [this] gets loose in the United States, it\'s going to be bad.</p>\n  \n  <footer>\n  \n      Joe Mendelson, Zoo Atlanta  \n</footer>\n</blockquote>\n\n  \n  \n      <p>The paper has more bad news. Researchers knew that Bsal makes spores with a tiny tail called a flagellum, which propels them toward amphibians. If spores dry out, they die. Otherwise, they typically survive for a few days before being eaten by protozoa. But Martel\'s group discovered that Bsal makes a second type of spore that looks much hardier and is rarely eaten by protozoa. "This will make it almost impossible to eradicate the fungus from the environment," says Martel, who adds that the spores can survive in pond water for more than 2 months.</p>\n\n<p>Another experiment showed that soil remained infectious for 48 hours after it was walked on by a sick salamander. In a separate lab test, the spores adhered to goose feet, suggesting they could hitchhike long distances on birds.</p>\n\n<p>The group also showed that two species that share the same habitat as the fire salamander are likely carriers of the disease. Midwife toads (<em>Alytes obstetricans</em>) could be infected with the fungus and shed spores for a few weeks, but they didn\'t get sick. A high dose of the fungus killed alpine newts (<em>Ichthyosaura alpestris</em>), but low doses made them infectious for months without killing them. As has happened with Bd in the Americas, Bsal will lurk in these reservoirs of disease even after local populations of fire salamanders vanish. Any fire salamanders that arrive from elsewhere will likely get infected by newts or toads.&#160;&#160;</p>\n  \n  <div class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-image">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ERRYR6-hires_16x9.jpg?itok=Wllbow77" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ERRYR6-hires_16x9.jpg?itok=Wllbow77 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/ERRYR6-hires_16x9.jpg?itok=_fM0PH9l 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption">\n  \n      <p>Midwife toads, known for carrying their eggs on their back, can spread the fungus while infected, but they don\'t get sick.</p>\n  \n</div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      Tierfotoagentur/Alamy Stock Photo  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n  \n  \n      <p>According to results from&#160;<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/630">previous infection trials</a>, most salamander species in Europe are likely just as vulnerable to Bsal. The fire salamander has a range that extends across Europe, and the fear is that the fungus will reach endangered salamanders. With small populations, these species could more easily be driven extinct, Fisher says. "The assumption is that they are all at risk," he says, and the findings in the new paper "have really upped their risk status." Martel and European colleagues recently started monitoring for Bsal in seven countries.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible to cure amphibians in the lab. For animals that can take the heat, like fire salamanders, 10 days at 25&#176;C will kill the fungus. Other species can be cured with a combination of two drugs. But there is no practical solution for animals in the wild, especially when their habitat is contaminated with fungal spores.</p>\n\n<p>Herpetologist Jaime Bosch of the National Museum of Natural History in Madrid had a rare success in eliminating a chytrid fungus from the wild. A few years ago, he and colleagues got <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/11/biologists-wipe-out-toad-killing-fungus-spanish-island">rid of Bd on the Spanish island of Mallorca</a> by temporarily removing some 2000 tadpoles of the Mallorcan midwife toad (<em>Alytes muletensis</em>) and disinfecting their ponds with powerful chemicals. But this success would be hard to replicate in less isolated locations, he says. "Right now, we are very far away from having any solution." The only hope in the meantime, Bosch and others say, is to slow the spread of the disease by ending the importation of amphibians.</p>\n\n<p>The United States, a hot spot of amphibian diversity, has already taken steps in that direction. Last year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="https://www.fws.gov/injuriouswildlife/salamanders.html">banned the import of 201 species of salamanders</a> on the grounds that they might introduce the fungus. Joe Mendelson, a herpetologist at Zoo Atlanta, says the new research suggests the list should be expanded to include other carriers such as the toad and newt studied in the new paper. "This is a very important piece of work, and it\'s terrifying," he says. "If Bsal gets loose in the United States," he says, "it\'s going to be bad."</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="A deadly salamander disease just got a lot scarier " class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

The provocative finding joins a flurry of other recent, sometimes controversial work attempting to find factors that explain the apparent antiaging properties of young blood.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;These are exciting results,&#8221; says Sally Temple, scientific director of the Neural Stem Cell Institute in Rensselaer, New York, who was not involved with the work. She and others say the new finding suggests that this and other factors in young blood may have different, complementary effects on the aging brain.</p>\n\n<p>Decades ago in somewhat grisly experiments, researchers found that sewing together the circulatory systems of an old and young mouse so that they shared the same blood supply rejuvenated the old animals. In 2014, as part of renewed interest in this unusual procedure, known as parabiosis, neuroscientist Tony Wyss-Coray&#8217;s lab at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, reported that it could mimic some of the brain-boosting effects of parabiosis with&#160;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/05/young-blood-renews-old-mice">injections of young mouse plasma, the cell-free part of blood</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Identifying the responsible factors in such blood is a challenge, however. Because mice are so tiny, it&#8217;s hard to collect enough mouse plasma to do biochemical and other analyses. As an alternative, Wyss-Coray&#8217;s lab recently tested the youngest human blood available&#8212;umbilical cord blood, which is traditionally thrown away after a birth but has become increasingly prized as physicians explore its therapeutic uses.</p>\n\n<p>In the new work, Wyss-Coray&#8217;s group gave human cord blood plasma to mice of varying ages that had defective immune systems and so did not reject the foreign human tissue. Like young mouse plasma, human cord plasma injected every 4 days for 2 weeks into the circulation activated neurons in old mice&#8217;s hippocampi, where memories are made and stored. (This activation did not happen in the hippocampi of young mice treated with cord blood.) After the injections, the aging animals also navigated a maze more quickly and performed better on other tests of learning and memory, Wyss-Coray&#8217;s team&#160;<a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature22067">reports today in&#160;<cite>Nature</cite></a>.</p>\n\n<p>The team then looked for blood proteins that are abundant in human cords but decline in the general circulation with age. They ultimately homed in one called TIMP2, which was previously known to control the production of enzymes that chop up the matrix around cells and play a role in wound healing as well as the spread of cancer. (Its full name is tissue metallopeptidase inhibitor 2.) Old mice injected with mouse TIMP2 scored almost as well on memory tests as those given cord plasma, although they still didn&#8217;t match the cognitive skills of young mice, Wyss-Coray says. To help clinch its case for TIMP2, the Stanford group also showed that cord blood depleted of TIMP2 did nothing for old mice, and blocking TIMP2 in young mice impaired their memory.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers&#8217; search for antiaging factors did not point to another protein,&#160;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/05/young-blood-renews-old-mice">GDF11</a>, which some scientists have reported stimulates the growth of new blood vessels and neural stem cells in the brain. (Another claim&#8212;that GDF11 rejuvenates muscle&#8212;has been hotly contested by several labs, partly because&#160;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/10/antiaging-protein-real-deal-harvard-team-claims">their studies suggest GDF11 levels rise with age</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>But Wyss-Coray says the new study does not rule on a role for GDF11 in the brain. Harvard University neuroscientist Lee Rubin, who co-led the GDF11 brain study, says the new findings suggest &#8220;it isn&#8217;t just one thing. A lot of individual factors in blood can improve function.&#8221; Indeed, one might want to combine GDF11 and TIMP2 treatments to both generate new neurons and &#8220;get the most out of the cells that are there,&#8221; Temple suggests.</p>\n\n<p>Some experts are less impressed by the study. Parabiosis researcher Irina Conboy of the University of California, Berkeley, notes that the paper doesn&#8217;t put the modest memory and learning improvements from TIMP2 in context by comparing them to, say, putting an old mouse on an exercise wheel, which can also improve cognitive function. Her own work suggests that the apparent antiaging effects of young blood may reflect the fact that&#160;<a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/11/22/young-blood-does-not-reverse-aging-in-old-mice-uc-berkeley-study-finds/">it contains less of certain factors in old blood that her lab and others have reported contribute to aging</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Stanford has filed for patents on using TIMP2 to treat aging-associated conditions, and Alkahest, a company in San Carlos, California, that Wyss-Coray co-founded, plans to develop it. An Alkahest-sponsored trial at Stanford testing young human plasma as a treatment in 18 Alzheimer&#8217;s disease patients ended in January; results will be presented at a meeting in November, says Alkahest CEO Karoly Nikolich. (Rubin serves on Alkahest&#8217;s advisory board.) Meanwhile, some clinics are already offering young blood injections&#160;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/08/young-blood-antiaging-trial-raises-questions">to reverse aging in people</a>. But Wyss-Coray and others say such treatments are premature.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Protein isolated from human cord blood has antiaging effects on memory in mice" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Bad teeth</h1>  <p class="byline byline--article">\n  By <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/author/virginia-morell">Virginia Morell</a><time>Apr. 19, 2017 , 5:00 AM</time></p>\n</header><p>In 1898, two male African lions killed 35 people in the Tsavo region of Kenya. Their 9-month reign of terror ended when Colonel John Patterson of the British Army shot them dead. Scientists have long debated why the lions began eating people. Now, two researchers have a new answer: They blame tooth decay for the big cats&#8217; taste for human flesh. The finding might also explain why other lions sometimes turn into human eaters.</p>\n\n<p>Lions normally consume a diverse variety of animals, including buffalo, wildebeest, giraffe, zebra, and antelope. Humans figure into their diets only rarely. In the 3 months before their deaths, however, the Tsavo human eaters <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2009/11/body-count-two-man-eating-lions">got nearly 30% of their food from people</a>, according to one recent study. Did the lions focus on humans because they were desperate? Many scientists think so. Apparently suffering from starvation&#8212;likely because drought or disease had ravaged their usual prey&#8212;they turned to another toothsome delicacy.</p>\n\n<p>But other researchers have turned up conflicting evidence. Larisa DeSantis, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, wanted a look at the lion&#8217;s preserved teeth after reading a frightful passage from Patterson&#8217;s 1907 account, <em>The Man-Eaters of Tsavo</em>: &#8220;I have a very vivid recollection of one particular night when the brutes seized a man from the railway camp and brought him close to my camp to devour. I could plainly hear them crunching the bones, and the sound &#8230; rang in my ears for days afterwards.&#8221; If the lions were that hungry, DeSantis reasoned, they must have also scavenged carcasses, a process that involves heavy bone crunching and wears down the teeth in predictable patterns.</p>\n  \n  <div class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-image">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/cc_Skull-of-first-Tsavo-man-eater2%2C-by-Bruce-Patterson-and-JP-Brown%2C-The-Field-Museum_16x9.jpg?itok=fCfEMvah" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/cc_Skull-of-first-Tsavo-man-eater2%2C-by-Bruce-Patterson-and-JP-Brown%2C-The-Field-Museum_16x9.jpg?itok=fCfEMvah 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/cc_Skull-of-first-Tsavo-man-eater2%2C-by-Bruce-Patterson-and-JP-Brown%2C-The-Field-Museum_16x9.jpg?itok=7ADY3jDR 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption">\n  \n      <p>The skull of one of the Tsavo&#160;man-eating lions</p>\n  \n</div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      Bruce Patterson and JP Brown &#169; The Field Museum  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n  \n  \n      <p>To find out, she and a colleague analyzed the lions&#8217; jaws and teeth, as well as those of a third human eater from Zambia&#8212;all stored at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois. They used a technique that can determine whether an animal is eating mostly flesh, bones, or some combination of the two. They then compared the patterns on the human eaters&#8217; teeth with those of 53 wild lion specimens from across Africa, two from India, and five captive lions. Next, the scientists examined the patterns on the teeth of cheetahs, which dine solely on flesh, and hyenas, which typically consume entire carcasses&#8212;including the bones.</p>\n\n<p>The Tsavo lions&#8217; teeth did not look like those of hyenas, DeSantis says. Instead, the wear patterns were &#8220;strikingly similar&#8221; to those of the zoo lions, which eat soft foods such as beef and horsemeat. She thinks Patterson was actually hearing the sounds of hyenas that dreadful night.</p>\n\n<p>Other research points out why the lions&#8217; dining preference shifted. One lion&#8212;the one that ate the most flesh&#8212;was known from a previous study to suffer from dental disease. A painful abscess at the root of one of his canines would have made normal hunting&#8212;grabbing and suffocating large prey&#8212;impossible, DeSantis says. His partner also had dental and jaw injuries, but these were less serious. The Zambian human eater, which did not consume bone, was also suffering from severe damage to its jaws. Together, this means that dental injuries and disease likely <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00948-5">led these lions to softer foods</a>, the researchers write today in <cite>Scientific Reports</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;[This] provides first-hand information straight from the lions&#8217; teeth that there is little evidence to support bone eating by the Tsavo lions,&#8221; says Jack Tseng, a vertebrate paleontologist at the State University of New York in&#160;Buffalo&#160;who was not involved in the study. &#8220;Any human bone consumption at the time was much more likely the work of the usual suspects&#8212;hyenas&#8212;than meat-specializing felines.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>But the scientists emphasize that bad teeth alone do not make lions into human eaters. &#8220;[They] probably targeted humans because they were easy and had soft flesh,&#8221; says DeSantis, noting that the cats didn&#8217;t consume entire carcasses. They were also doing what lions do best: hunting opportunistically from a menu that has, since the emergence of early humans, occasionally included people.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Why did these lions eat 35 men?

The island&#8217;s now-famous predator-prey study has tracked how wolf and moose numbers have risen and fallen in tandem over the decades, and left their mark on the island&#8217;s ecology.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>In contrast to&#160;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/extreme-inbreeding-likely-spells-doom-isle-royale-wolves">last year&#8217;s winter study</a>, when wolf tracks were the only evidence of the predators, wildlife ecologist Rolf Peterson spotted both wolves sitting on lake ice on the January afternoon he arrived on the island.&#160; Weeks later, Peterson and co-investigator John Vucetich, both of Michigan Technological University in Houghton, found the wolves feeding on a freshly-killed moose calf. &#8220;We were very lucky,&#8221; Peterson says. &#8220;There was no mystery left in terms of the wolf population,&#8221; or what they were eating.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>The researchers also observed that, in what normally would have been the wolves&#8217; breeding period, the 7-year-old female bared her teeth in response to the close interest of the 9-year-old male; he is both her father and half sibling.&#160; Researchers don&#8217;t expect the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article-abstract/108/2/120/2667696/Genomic-Variation-of-Inbreeding-and-Ancestry-in">highly inbred pair</a> to reproduce.</p>\n\n<p>The two wolves otherwise appeared healthy and still have all their canines, a key sign of well-being in the carnivores. The pair has already surpassed the average Isle Royale wolf lifespan of 4 years, dodging the main causes of death for their ancestors on the island: other wolves and starvation. &#8220;They are swimming in moose,&#8221; Vucetich says.</p>\n\n<p>The four wolf-killed carcasses the researchers spotted made little dent in the overall moose population, estimated at 1600 in aerial surveys conducted this past winter.&#160; The 20% increase from last winter is consistent with the population&#8217;s growth rate over the past 6 years, as <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/04/inbred-wolf-population-isle-royale-collapses">the inbred wolf population dwindled and collapsed</a>.&#160; Both beaver and moose abundance have tripled since 2011, &#8220;undoubtedly because of lack of predation,&#8221; Vucetich says.</p>\n\n<p>With moose density on the Guam-sized island already five to ten times higher than on the mainland--and with the numbers on track to double in three to four years&#8212;browsing on the island&#8217;s vegetation is intense. One aquatic plant, floating watershield (<em>Brassenia&#160; schreberi</em>), which was abundant six years ago when moose were at historic lows, now thrives in ponds only where moose are excluded. &#8220;It&#8217;s the aquatic equivalent of deforestation,&#8221; says plant ecologist Eric Hellquist of SUNY Oswego, noting that moose&#8217;s effect on aquatic vegetation is not as well studied as that on terrestrial plants. Isle Royale&#8217;s ponds are demonstrating &#8220;how apex predators can have cascading effects on food webs.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n<p>As the effects of the missing predators ripple through the island, the Park Service is assessing about 5000 public comments on <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/12/reversal-us-park-service-aims-move-new-wolves-isle-royale">its proposal to introduce 20 to 30 wolves</a> to the island to establish a new population. The next steps on that plan are expected by the end of this year.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Two wolves survive in world&#8217;s longest running predator-prey study " class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Past studies on the spread of certain lifestyle choices&#8212;from altruism to overeating&#8212;have shown that habits can travel like viruses, for good or bad. But this is the first study to rigorously analyze exercise contagion on a large scale. Using fitness tracker data posted to a social site by more than 1 million U.S. runners, researchers analyzed the distances, speeds, and total time they ran, covering 350 million kilometers over 5 years. But how to measure whether social network &#8220;friends&#8221; could influence one another? First, scientists had to tease out confounding effects like the propensity to run more on weekends. So they let the weather set up their experiment, on the understanding that nice weather is likelier to make people run. They found that as people in cities with nice weather went for especially long runs, their friends in unaffected cities would extend their own runs, increasing their running distance and time and burning more calories. That suggests that at least <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms14753">some of that extra exercise is thanks to social influence</a>, the researchers write today in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Men appeared more susceptible than&#160;women: They were strongly affected by male friends and moderately affected by&#160;female friends, whereas women were moderately affected by&#160;other women and unaffected by&#160;men. But less active runners also had an outsized influence on others. As lazier runners put in more time or distance, their friends from afar responded in kind. The&#160;researchers say their findings suggest that to encourage healthy behavior, you should target an entire social&#160;network, not just one individual. After all, what&#8217;s a race with only one person?</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Exercise is contagious, especially if you&#8217;re a man" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

And for just as long, skeptics have scoffed on the grounds that sound waves coming from meteors should arrive several&#160;minutes&#160;<em>after</em> the light waves, which travel nearly a million times faster. Now, scientists have proposed a theory to explain how our eyes and ears could perceive a meteor at nearly the same time. The hypothesis might also explain how auroras produce sound, a claim made by many indigenous peoples living at high latitudes.</p>\n\n<p>Meteors&#160;release huge amounts of energy as they disintegrate in the atmosphere. They also produce low frequency radio waves that travel at the speed of light. Some scientists have suggested that those radio waves produce the sound that accompanies meteors. The waves can cause everyday objects&#8212;including fences, hair, and glasses&#8212;to vibrate, which our ears pick up as sound between 20 and 20,000 Hertz. This phenomenon, called electrophonics, is a well-known principle: &#8220;The conversion from electromagnetic waves to sound waves &#8230; is exactly how your radio works,&#8221; says Colin Price, an atmospheric scientist at Tel Aviv University in Israel and co-author of the new study. &#8220;But in this case nature provides the conversion between electromagnetic waves and acoustic waves.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>But nailing down that scenario isn&#8217;t easy. Reports of noisy meteors are relatively scarce&#8212;there were only 40 last year, according to the American Meteor Society (AMS). And because most of these &#8220;hearings&#8221; have been made by amateur sky watchers, it&#8217;s difficult to find audio recordings to back them up. &#8220;[We&#8217;ve] never had [a recording] cross our path,&#8221; says David Meisel in Geneseo, New York, executive director of AMS. Moreover, a key question remains to be answered: How do the meteors produce low-frequency radio waves in the first place?</p>\n\n<p>Now, Price and Michael Kelley, a physicist at Cornell University, have developed a model to answer that question. As a&#160;meteor&#160;streaks through Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, it ionizes the air around it, splitting it into heavy, positively charged ions and lighter, negatively charged electrons. The ions follow the meteor, whereas the electrons are deflected by Earth&#8217;s magnetic field. That separation of positive and negative charges in the meteor&#8217;s wake produces a large electric field that drives an electrical current. And <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL072911/full">it&#8217;s that current that launches the radio waves</a>, Price and Kelley hypothesize in an upcoming issue of <cite>Geophysical Research Letters</cite>. The size of the meteor and its speed through the atmosphere would control the frequency of the radio waves, they predict.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, another research team presented a different hypothesis <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep41251">to explain how meteors make sound</a>. That team proposed that visible light from a meteor heats up materials such as hair and glasses, which then vibrate and produce sound waves. But this theory requires a &#8220;huge&#8221; light source, Price says. Only meteors as bright as the full moon could emit enough light to produce such sound waves. But according to the new theory, all meteors generate radio waves that can produce sound, some of which our ears are capable of picking up.</p>\n\n<p>Price and Kelley suggest that their model might also explain reports of &#8220;clapping&#8221; sounds accompanying auroras, the colorful light displays created when charged particles from the sun collide with molecules in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere at high latitudes. These sounds feature prominently in stories of native peoples of the northern United States, Greenland, and Canada, but they have largely been dismissed by scientists. &#8220;Auroras also create radio waves that can easily reach the ground,&#8221; Kelley says. &#160;</p>\n\n<p>The new hypothesis is &#8220;reasonable,&#8221; says Meers Oppenheim, an astronomer at Boston University not involved in the study. But it&#8217;s difficult to simulate what&#8217;s truly going on 100 kilometers up in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere as tiny particles of dust whiz by at 50 or more kilometers per second. &#8220;The devil lies in the details, and no one seems to have truly worked through those,&#8221; he says.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="New theory may explain the &#8216;music of the meteors&#8217;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Whereas empty space should feel immeasurably cold to any observer gliding along at a constant speed, one who is accelerating, say because he\'s riding a rocket, would find empty space hot. This so-called Unruh effect seemed practically impossible to measure, but now four theorists claim they have devised a doable experiment that could confirm the underlying physics. Skeptics say it will do no such thing&#8212;but for contradictory reasons.</p>\n\n<p>"The hope is that this will convince skeptics that the whole thing is coherent," says Stephen Fulling, a theoretical physicist and mathematician at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station who was not involved in the work. But Vladimir Belinski, a theorist at International Network of Centers for Relativistic Astrophysics in Pescara, Italy, says, "The Unruh effect is nonsense, it\'s based on a mathematical mistake."</p>\n\n<p>According to Albert Einstein\'s theories of special and general relativity, things can appear bizarrely different to observers in motion relative to one another. Suppose you stand next to a meter stick with a watch on your wrist. If your friend zips past at near&#8211;light-speed, she\'ll see that the stick is shorter than a meter and that your watch ticks abnormally slowly. Conversely, if she carries a meter stick, you\'ll see it contract and, to you, <em>her</em> watch will tick slowly.</p>\n\n<p>Things get even weirder if one observer accelerates. Any observer traveling at a constant speed will measure the temperature of empty space as absolute zero. But an accelerated observer will find the vacuum hotter. At least that\'s what William Unruh, a theorist at the University British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, argued in 1976. To a nonaccelerating observer, the vacuum is devoid of particles&#8212;so that if he holds a particle detector it will register no clicks. In contrast, Unruh argued, an accelerated observer will detect a fog of photons and other particles, as the number of quantum particles flitting about depends on an observer\'s motion. The greater the acceleration, the higher the temperature of that fog or "bath."</p>\n\n<p>The effect is too feeble to measure directly. To see the vacuum heat to 1 K, an observer would have to accelerate 100 quadrillion times faster than the best rocket can. But Daniel Vanzella, a theorist at the University of S&#227;o Paulo in S&#227;o Carlos, Brazil, and colleagues argue that it should be possible to detect the key thing&#8212;the fog of photons seen by the accelerating observer&#8212;by studying light radiated by electrons.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how that would work: Suppose you shoot a bunch of electrons laterally across a magnetic field. Basic physics dictates that the electrons will turn circles in the field. Now, apply a vertical electric field to also give the electrons an upward push. As well as circulating, the bunch of will also accelerate upward. The setup thus defines two frames of reference. In the frame accelerating upward with the bunch, the electrons turn circles (see figure). In the nonaccelerating "lab frame" the bunch traces a stretched corkscrew trajectory.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="graphic entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-figure"><h3 class="graphic__header">Testing the Unruh effect</h3>\n  <div class="graphic__body">\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The proposed experiment is a tale of two reference frames.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/040617SNOW_electronCorkskrew.jpg?itok=NFa5Og7r" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/040617SNOW_electronCorkskrew.jpg?itok=NFa5Og7r 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/040617SNOW_electronCorkskrew.jpg?itok=jYb7UaZl 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption"></div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      V. Altounian/<i>Science</i>, adapted from Adrian Cho  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure></figure><p>Vanzella and colleagues start their analysis in the accelerating frame, where they assume the circulating electrons encounter that fog of photons. The electrons will both absorb photons from and radiate photons into the fog. Weirdly, every event in the accelerated frame in which the electrons absorb or emit a photon corresponds to an event in the lab frame in which the electrons emit a photon. The theorists use relativity theory to&#160;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03446">predict the spectrum of emitted photons in the lab</a>&#160;frame, as they report in a paper in press at&#160;<cite>Physical Review Letters</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>In the lab frame, they calculate, the spectrum of emitted photons should have a tell-tale excess at long wavelengths&#8212;but only if there was a fog of photons in the accelerating frame to begin with, Vanzella says. Roughly speaking, the fog of photons in the accelerated frame heats up the electrons and makes them radiate a bit more in the lab frame. Thus, the experiment would provide a way to test whether the Unruh effect exists: Observe the excess of long-wavelength photons in the lab frame, and you\'ll know that the accelerated frame space is full of photons.</p>\n\n<p>Skeptics say the experiment won&#8217;t work, but they disagree on why. If the situation isproperly analyzed, there is no fog of photons in the accelerated frame, says Detlev Buchholz, a theorist at the University of G&#246;ttingen in Germany. "The Unruh gas does not exist!" he says. Nevertheless, Buchholz says, the vacuum will appear hot to an accelerated observer, but because of a kind of friction that arises through the interplay of quantum uncertainty and acceleration. So,the experiment might show the desired effect, but that wouldn\'t reveal the supposed fog of photons in the accelerating frame.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, Robert O\'Connell, a theorist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, insists that in the accelerated frame there is a fog of photons. However, he contends, it is not possible to draw energy out of that fog to produce extra radiation in the lab frame. O\'Connell cites a basic bit of physics called the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which states that a particle interacting with a heat bath will pump as much energy into the bath as it pulls out. Thus, he argues, Unruh\'s fog of photons exists, but the experiment should not produce the supposed signal anyway.</p>\n\n<p>The discord aside, George Matsas, a theorist also at S&#227;o Paulo State University and an author on the new paper says he&#8217;s looking for experimenters interested in performing the test. It could be done with particle accelerators and electromagnets currently available, Matsas says. "The parameters in the paper were chosen to be realistic," he says. Even if the experiment works as predicted, however, the debate over the Unruh effect seems likely to smolder on.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Does space heat up when you accelerate?

The new weather forecast has rolled in, and the climate scientists, even though it&#8217;s not typically their business, dig out their phones to look: snow tomorrow&#8212;hardly unusual for early February in Princeton, New Jersey. But the weather models have the storm breaking severe, dumping a foot or more. A snow day seems likely.</p>\n\n<p>Across the table at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), Shian-Jiann &#8220;S. J.&#8221; Lin is not convinced. He is the master of 20,000 lines of computer code that divide the atmosphere into boxes and, with canny accuracy, solve the equations that describe how air swirls around the globe. For decades, Lin&#8217;s program has powered the long-term simulations of many climate models, including GFDL&#8217;s&#8212;one of the crown jewels of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Now, Lin&#8217;s domain is expanding to a different side of NOAA: the short-term weather forecasts of the National Weather Service (NWS). By 2018, Lin&#8217;s program will be powering a unified system for both climate and weather forecasting, one that could predict conditions tomorrow, or a century from now&#8212;and do it faster and better than current models. His work will soon be guiding mayors planning not just for snow plows, but also rising seas.</p>\n\n<p>But Lin has started early. His small team is already running a prototype forecast on their supercomputer. And in his typically confident and brash style, he offers a minority report about the next day&#8217;s storm.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;If our forecast is correct, it&#8217;s only 3 to 6 inches,&#8221; Lin announces. His peers at the&#160;table seem skeptical. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a mess,&#8221; one warns. But Lin doesn&#8217;t budge. He rarely needs to. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see what we get tomorrow,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You want to bet?&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Much is riding on Lin. Recently, NWS has suffered some prominent embarrassments, such as in 2012, when it predicted Hurricane Sandy would sputter out over the ocean while a leading European center accurately forecast the direct hit on New York City. Fed up with the country&#8217;s second-place status, Congress in 2013 poured $48 million into NWS weather modeling. The message for NOAA was clear: Get America on top.</p>\n\n<p>This drive has opened up an opportunity. For a long time, meteorologists and climate scientists operated in separate domains. Meteorologists focused on speed: ingesting as many data as possible from satellites, balloons, and buoys and quickly spinning it into a forecast. Climate scientists focused on the fussy physics of their models to produce plausible simulations over decades. But now, the two groups are discovering common ground, in &#8220;subseasonal to seasonal&#8221; predictions&#8212;from a month to 2 years out. In order to push forecasts beyond 10 days or so, meteorologists need the superior physics of the climate models. Meanwhile, climate scientists want to know how weather phenomena that happen on monthly or annual timescales, like El Ni&#241;o, influence the global climate. &#8220;The two cultures are speaking each other&#8217;s language, and realizing they&#8217;re going to live and die together,&#8221; says John Michalakes, an atmospheric scientist at the Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, California.</p>\n\n<p>There could be another benefit to blurring the lines between weather and climate, one that climate scientists are loath to talk about explicitly. Although studies of human-driven climate change have faced scrutiny and scorn from conservative politicians in the United States, weather research remains solidly bipartisan, says David Titley, director of the Center for Solutions to Weather and Climate Risk at Pennsylvania State University in State College. Just this month, for example, Congress passed a weather forecasting bill that dedicates $26.5 million of NOAA&#8217;s budget to improving its seasonal predictions, and climate change doubters were among the supporters. &#8220;If I were running the world, I would keep that divide vague,&#8221; Titley says.</p>\n\n<p>In his modeling, Lin never made the distinction. &#8220;From the beginning we talked about how there is no difference between weather and climate,&#8221; says Ricky Rood, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Lin&#8217;s longtime collaborator. But others haven&#8217;t wanted to hear that message&#8212;and especially not from Lin, who is as feisty and fractious as a government employee can get. &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing to me,&#8221; says Rood, &#8220;that S. J. could evolve to be a source of unification.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Storms have roiled around Lin his whole life. Typhoons are regular events in Taipei, where he grew up, and he was always fascinated by their power. &#8220;I have hurricanes in my blood,&#8221; he says. Born in 1958 to parents who ran a small construction company, he was the first in his family to go to college. As a student at National Taiwan University, he studied microprocessor architectures, along with meteorology and fluid dynamics. He became fascinated with the challenge of rendering the continuous currents of the atmosphere in the discontinuous, 0-or-1 world of computer code.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, Taiwan was a dictatorship, and Lin joined student groups opposed to the regime. After college, he faced several years of mandatory military service. He aced his entry test and assumed he would land a cushy engineering job in Taipei. Instead, he was shipped to the Matsu Islands, 16 kilometers from the Chinese mainland. He was hardly a model soldier. He hated having to recite party doctrine during assemblies. &#8220;You had to pretend, and say something not in your heart,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n<p>Taiwan didn&#8217;t seem to have a place for him, so in 1983 he enrolled in the aerospace engineering department at the University of Oklahoma, one of the only schools he could afford. He wanted to be a rocket scientist. But it was a tough transition. He cared more about learning computer languages than English, and felt isolated. His accent is a barrier, but not the only one. &#8220;Some folks tend to have a difficult time following S. J.,&#8221; says Bill Putman, a meteorologist at NASA&#8217;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and another longtime collaborator. &#8220;But it&#8217;s not necessarily a language barrier. It&#8217;s more a knowledge barrier.&#8221; Seeing his talent for computational fluid dynamics, his adviser suggested Lin switch to Princeton University, which with its partnership with GFDL is a hotbed for atmospheric modeling.</p>\n\n<p>He learned how GFDL scientists divided the air into a 3D grid that spanned the globe and stretched from the surface to the stratosphere, following lines of latitude and longitude. Along points on the grid, they would set initial conditions&#8212;the weather or climate for a given moment in time. Then, point by point, the computer would solve equations describing changes in wind, air pressure, temperature, and humidity for successive steps in time. Computers were room-sized mainframes at the time, and the model grids were huge, with a mesh size of 500 kilometers. The models could recreate only the largest atmospheric features, like jet streams and the Hadley cell, the belt that circulates warm air from the equator to the subtropics.</p>\n\n<p>After graduate school, Lin decided to stay in the United States. &#8220;I&#8217;m now more American than I am Taiwanese,&#8221; he says. He drinks whisky, but infuses it with ginseng. He returned to the University of Oklahoma as a postdoc to work on modeling tornadoes. But computers couldn&#8217;t yet model events that unfold at such small scales. The failure was humbling, and Lin says it provided a mantra: &#8220;Choose the right level of complexity for the particular problem, at the time that you have the resources to do it.&#8221; Lin soon found the right problem at NASA.&#160;</p>\n  \n  <div class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-image">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ma_0414_NF_SJLin_tornado_NEW_700px.jpg?itok=Ee9FTpFx" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/ma_0414_NF_SJLin_tornado_NEW_700px.jpg?itok=Ee9FTpFx 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/ma_0414_NF_SJLin_tornado_NEW_700px.jpg?itok=HpHgxBnv 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption">\n  \n      <p>At high resolution, Lin&#8217;s model can simulate tornadoes, such as the 2013 twister in Moore, Oklahoma, that killed 24 people.</p>\n  \n</div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      VINCENT DELIGNY/AFP/GETTY IMAGES  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n  \n  \n      <p>In the late 1980s, Rood was working on the problem of the Antarctic ozone hole at Goddard. NASA was flying research planes into the hole to measure the chemicals that might be destroying it. These flights revealed a drop in several short-lived reactive nitrogen oxides, which allowed chlorine from humanmade chemicals to linger,&#160;priming further reactions that broke down the ozone. But Rood&#8217;s atmospheric models couldn&#8217;t simulate the flows and reactions. No matter what he did, the nitrogen reactants remained steady.</p>\n\n<p>How could that happen? At the time, an elegant mathematical solution had overtaken global modeling, called the spectral method. Rather than solving at points on a latitude-longitude grid, scientists realized that fluid flow in the atmosphere could be represented as the sum of a series of hundreds of sinusoidal, crisscrossing waves. The code ran faster, and the results could be transformed back onto a regular grid. The spectral method still powers most global weather forecasts today, including at NWS. But the speed comes with a cost: When the waves are projected back into physical space, mass can gradually grow unbalanced. For weather models, which only run for days into the future, this is not a big deal. But for models of atmospheric chemistry and climate, which run for much longer periods, these distortions were a critical flaw.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately for Rood, a young Taiwanese scientist had written to him, lured by his publications. When Lin joined NASA in 1992 as a contractor, the two set out to build a model that, above all else, preserved mass. This first meant jettisoning the spectral method. It also meant upgrading from finite-difference modeling, which solves for points on a grid, to a finite-volume model, which solves for conditions averaged across each cell, or box, and is ideally suited for conserving mass because the calculations pass fluxes, or volumes, of material from one box to the next. Others had considered such a solution, but thought it too complex or computationally expensive.</p>\n\n<p>But Lin was a master of computational efficiency. Over a furious few years in the mid-1990s, he and Rood expanded their model beyond chemical transport&#8212;for which it remains the standard&#8212;to a fullfledged dynamical core fast enough to be used for climate models. Put a mote of dust in the air, says Paul Ginoux, an aerosol modeler at GFDL, who also worked with Lin at Goddard, &#8220;and this code will transport it at the right place, at the right moment. And that&#8217;s beautiful.&#8221; The name of the code was far more mundane. They called it &#8220;FV,&#8221; for finite-volume, and later FV3.</p>\n\n<p>Their work soon drew the attention of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, one of the country&#8217;s leading institutes for weather and climate science, which incorporated FV into its influential climate model. NASA&#8217;s climate laboratory in New York City adopted it as well. And in 2003, GFDL lured Lin away to upgrade FV and fold it into its global simulation. The results of these models, some of the top U.S. contributions to the United Nations panel on climate change, have informed much of what the public hears about global warming. And they&#8217;ve all had Lin&#8217;s innovations at their heart.</p>\n\n<p>There\'s a term of art at NOAA for the reactive way Congress finances weather research: &#8220;budgeting by disaster.&#8221; It&#8217;s rarely pretty, and it&#8217;s why the coming merger in atmospheric modeling will, at its root, be thanks to the calamities of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>In 2005, after NWS failed to forecast Katrina&#8217;s direct hit on New Orleans, Louisiana, until 2 days out, Congress set aside money to improve predictions of Atlantic hurricanes. As it happened, it was around this time that Lin walked into the office of his boss at GFDL, Isaac Held, and declared: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to revolutionize weather prediction.&#8221; Computers were now capable of processing boxes small enough to render hurricanes. More important, Lin had developed a key bit of physics needed for FV3 to forecast realistic hurricanes. Many global forecasting models operate using an assumption called the hydrostatic principle&#8212;where the gravity of the air in any box is exactly balanced by the upward force of the air pressure in the box below it. This works for coarse models, which cannot directly simulate the fine upward and downward flows in the real atmosphere. But recreating weather events like hurricanes and thunderstorms, where updrafts are important, requires breaking this hydrostatic principle. After a decade of mulling, Lin finally had an efficient way of incorporating nonhydrostatic flows into his code.</p>\n\n<p>He needed to test it. Frank Marks, who leads hurricane research at NOAA&#8217;s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami, Florida, was overseeing improvements for the regional hurricane model for the Atlantic basin. With a smaller area to model, Marks can afford to have fine-scale boxes. Lin convinced him to use Katrina dollars to buy extra supercomputer time. Run FV3 at a 1-kilometer resolution, Lin promised, and the finest details of cyclones would arise. Sure enough, the violent walls of a hurricane&#8217;s eye opened in his code.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="graphic entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-figure"><h3 class="graphic__header">Zooming in on storms</h3>\n  <div class="graphic__body">\n<p>The FV3 model divides the atmosphere into boxes and simulates conditions in each one.

BICKEL/<i>SCIENCE</i>; XI CHEN (PRINCETON UNIVERSITY); NASA&#8217;S GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure></figure><p>In 2014, when NOAA announced a competition to choose the &#8220;core&#8221; of the agency&#8217;s next-generation weather forecast system, Lin was ready.</p>\n\n<p>Five models were entered, including FV3. And by the summer of 2015, FV3 was one of two frontrunners, along with the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS), the globalized version of a long-standing system produced by NCAR and used by many researchers. They would be judged on their speed and accuracy in mimicking the atmosphere&#8217;s flows.</p>\n\n<p>For 6 months, Lin&#8217;s placid office turned frenetic, as his team worked nights and weekends to embed FV3 within the weather service&#8217;s system. &#8220;There was never a time where I thought we were losing the battle on scientific ground,&#8221; Lin says. One advantage of his model was efficiency. It is Lin&#8217;s obsession&#8212;and not just at work: When Hurricane Sandy knocked out power at Lin&#8217;s modest home, he refused to use a normal generator, and instead rigged his Prius up to his home wiring. Its battery, he explained, would make certain any extra electricity the car&#8217;s generator churned out wouldn&#8217;t go to waste.</p>\n\n<p>So that FV3 could make efficient use of limited computing power, Lin and his team had written the code to work in parallel. This is hard for global models, where the weather in one box can influence another box a hemisphere away. But this interconnectedness isn&#8217;t as big a problem in the vertical dimension, so Lin enabled FV3&#8217;s layers to be detached from each other and be processed in parallel. He won additional efficiencies by changing the shape of the grid. Climate models are plagued by the so-called pole problem, the result of the strangely squished and stretched boxes near the poles. So Lin and Putman, his former&#160;NASA colleague, abandoned the latitudelongitude system in favor of a cubed sphere. Picture a six-sided die inflated like a balloon. There were no more poles to handle, just six square panels, with tricky interactions at the seams.</p>\n\n<p>The net result: compared with MPAS, FV3 took a third as many computer processors to run at operational standards. It also scaled more efficiently to a vast number of processors, and it could zoom in to model one part of the globe at high resolution without skewing its performance in coarser regions. It was a slaughter. NCAR withdrew its model before NOAA anointed FV3 as the winner, in July 2016. &#8220;There was just never any conclusive evidence that MPAS had an advantage that was worth the cost,&#8221; says Michalakes, who led the computing comparisons.</p>\n\n<p>During the competition, Lin had complained that NOAA was biased in favor of MPAS; now, he crows about his victory. &#8220;Most people in that discipline paid no respect to what we had been doing,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They found out the hard way.&#8221; With NCAR toppled, Lin now faces far bigger rivals: the United Kingdom&#8217;s Met Office, which since the early 1990s has been the only center to have merged its weather and climate forecasts, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts, which has long run the top-rated weather model.</p>\n\n<p>This time around, he&#8217;ll need help.</p>\n\n<p>European modelers start with the same set of balloon, satellite, and ground measurements as everyone else. But they cleverly inject randomness into these initial conditions, then do multiple runs to come up with a &#8220;consensus&#8221; forecast. Getting the United States up to those standards will require winning over U.S. researchers to provide innovative techniques that Lin and his colleagues can adapt for their model.</p>\n\n<p>Yet there&#8217;s a risk that academic weather scientists will avoid using FV3 and instead stick with MPAS, more comfortable with its origins and documentation, says Cliff Mass, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. Lin&#8217;s reluctance to break down his code in the past has heightened concerns. &#8220;Lin is a brilliant modeler,&#8221; Mass says. &#8220;He&#8217;s not big on community support.&#8221; But Putman believes Lin will embrace true improvements. &#8220;If he sees something that will push this code beyond where it is now, I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s willing to adapt.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>At a workshop next week, NWS will lay out its aggressive timetable for turning on FV3. By this May, FV3 ought to be fully wired into the service&#8217;s data assimilation. And by the first half of 2018, if all goes well, NOAA will flip the switch, making it the standard forecast that feeds into all of our phones.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Lin&#8217;s team continues to tinker with FV3. They&#8217;re honing a more powerful zooming technique: allowing the grid to create nests of high-resolution boxes, 2 to 3 kilometers a side, over regions of interest. This could allow high-resolution hurricane forecasts to be run at the same time as global predictions, with no need to wait for the global run to finish. And it could capture tornado outbreaks and severe storms, weather that has been too finegrained for existing global models. &#8220;We&#8217;re kind of ambitious,&#8221; Lin says. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to cover everything.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>On a screen at GFDL, Lucas Harris, Lin&#8217;s deputy, zooms in on Oklahoma, where a nested FV3 grid is recreating the events of May 2013. It was that month that a severe twister plowed through Moore, Oklahoma, killing 24. As the model runs, scattered storms organize into a line of squalls. Then anvil clouds form&#8212;the thunderstorm cells from which tornadoes would touch down on Moore. Next, Harris changes the place and time, to the eastern United States in June 2012, when a bow of thunderstorms&#8212;a so-called derecho&#8212;caught forecasters off guard and in some areas knocked out power for a week. The model sees traces of the storm nearly 3 days in advance. &#8220;Previously,&#8221; Harris says, &#8220;it was believed there was only 12 hours of predictability to this event.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>So far these results have stayed in the lab, but Lin is doing his best to spread the gospel. For the 2017 hurricane season, his prototype will run alongside existing regional hurricane models. And next month, Lin will return to Oklahoma for the &#8220;Spring Experiment,&#8221; a research jamboree of severe storm scientists, to test how the zooming technique could help local forecasters.</p>\n\n<p>All this collaboration, this dependence on outside contributions, makes Lin nervous. His model is moving out of the lab into the messy real world. Will it become the bedrock of all weather and climate prediction, from tornadoes next week to temperature rises next decade? &#8220;I&#8217;m cautiously optimistic, but not overly optimistic,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n<p>A good omen comes the next morning. Snow blankets Princeton&#8212;beautiful, but also manageable. Nearly 6 inches fell, not a foot or more. GFDL could have stayed open. Over the ether, Lin can&#8217;t resist a final comment. &#8220;The snow,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;is not as bad as forecasted.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Take that, Europe.

The device can produce nearly 3 liters of water per day for every kilogram of spongelike absorber it contains, and researchers say future versions will be even better. That means homes in the driest parts of the world could soon have a solar-powered appliance capable of delivering all the water they need, offering relief to billions of people. &#160;</p>\n  \n  <div class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-image align-right">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/cc_device_final.png?itok=JMvRxv-z" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/cc_device_final.png?itok=JMvRxv-z 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/cc_device_final.png?itok=34o2Kc4G 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption">\n  \n      <p>The new water harvester is made of metal organic framework&#160;crystals pressed into a thin sheet of copper metal and placed between a solar absorber (above) and a condenser plate (below).</p>\n  \n</div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      Wang Laboratory at MIT  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n  \n  \n      <p>There are an estimated 13 trillion liters of water floating in the atmosphere at any one time, equivalent to 10% of all of the freshwater in our planet&#8217;s lakes and rivers. Over the years, researchers have developed ways to grab a few trickles, such as using fine nets to wick water from fog banks, or power-hungry dehumidifiers to condense it out of the air. But both approaches require either very humid air or far too much electricity to be broadly useful.</p>\n\n<p>To find an all-purpose solution, researchers led by Omar Yaghi, a chemist at the University of California, Berkeley, turned to a family of crystalline powders called metal organic frameworks, or MOFs. Yaghi developed the first MOFs&#8212;porous crystals that form continuous 3D networks&#8212;more than 20 years ago. The networks assemble in a Tinkertoy-like fashion from metal atoms that act as the hubs and sticklike organic compounds that link the hubs together. By choosing different metals and organics, chemists can dial in the properties of each MOF, controlling what gases bind to them, and how strongly they hold on.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past 2 decades chemists have synthesized more than 20,000 MOFs, each with unique molecule-grabbing properties. For example, Yaghi and others recently designed MOFs that absorb&#8212;and later release&#8212;methane,&#160;<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/538">making them a type of high-capacity gas tank</a>&#160;for natural gas&#8211;powered vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>In 2014, Yaghi and his colleagues synthesized a MOF that excelled at absorbing water, even under low-humidity conditions. That led him to reach out to Evelyn Wang, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, with whom he had previously worked on a project to use MOFs in automobile air conditioning. After synthesizing the new zirconium-based MOF, dubbed MOF-801, Yaghi met Wang at MIT and said, &#8220;Evelyn we have to come up with a water-harvesting device.&#8221; She agreed to give it a shot.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="graphic entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-figure"><h3 class="graphic__header">Device pulls water from the air</h3>\n  <div class="graphic__body">\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At night setup soaks up water vapor from air, and uses heat from the sun to release it as liquid water during the day.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/0413SNOWWaterHarvester.jpg?itok=jQssOzKk" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/0413SNOWWaterHarvester.jpg?itok=jQssOzKk 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/0413SNOWWaterHarvester.jpg?itok=G8IsPw7b 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption"></div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      V.

That sheet is placed between a solar absorber and a condenser plate and positioned inside a chamber. At night the chamber is opened, allowing ambient air to diffuse through the porous MOF and water molecules to stick to its interior surfaces, gathering in groups of eight to form tiny cubic droplets. In the morning, the chamber is closed, and sunlight entering through a window on top of the device then heats up the MOF, which liberates the water droplets and drives them&#8212;as vapor&#8212;toward the cooler condenser. The temperature difference, as well as the high humidity inside the chamber, causes the vapor to condense as liquid water, which drips into a collector. The setup works so well that&#160;<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aam8743">it pulls 2.8 liters of water out of the air per day</a>&#160;for every kilogram of MOF it contained, the Berkeley and MIT team reports today in&#160;<cite>Science</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It has been a longstanding dream&#8221; to harvest water from desert air, says Mercouri Kanatzidis, a chemist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who wasn&#8217;t involved with the work. &#8220;This demonstration &#8230; is a significant proof of concept.&#8221; It&#8217;s also one that Yaghi says has plenty of room for improvement. For starters, zirconium costs $150 a kilogram, making water-harvesting devices too expensive to be broadly useful. However, Yaghi says his group has already had early success in designing water-grabbing MOFs that replace zirconium with aluminum, a metal that is 100 times cheaper. That could make future water harvesters cheap enough not only to slake the thirst of people in arid regions, but perhaps even supply water to farmers in the desert.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>*Update, 14 March, 12:28 p.m.:</strong>&#160;This item has been updated to reflect the fact that the device pulls nearly 3 liters of water out of the air for every kilogram of the water-absorbing material that is used.</em></p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="This new solar-powered device can pull water straight from the desert air" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

For most of his career, the microbiologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, paid the discipline little attention, but he did notice the <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf">field-shaking 2009 report</a> from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), which found that many forensic techniques, from fingerprint comparisons to bloodstain pattern analysis, lacked a firm scientific footing. &#8220;I remember reading [NAS] about this and I said, &#8216;Oh my God, I thought fingerprints had been validated,&#8217;&#8221; he remembers.</p>\n\n<p>He would soon play a direct role in the field&#8217;s reform, as one of a handful of basic researchers invited to serve alongside lawyers, judges, and forensic practitioners on a panel, created by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), in partnership with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to advise DOJ on how to respond to the NAS report&#8217;s concerns. Since its founding in 2013, the panel has published 43 documents and made 20 official recommendations to the attorney general, including a call for the universal accreditation of forensic practitioners and for the phasing out of the meaningless phrase &#8220;reasonable scientific certainty&#8221; that is common in courtrooms.</p>\n\n<p>Last week, Casadevall and five other scientific members of the commission <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3549346/Scientists-on-national-commission-urge-panel-be.pdf">wrote a letter</a> to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and acting National Institute of Standards and Technology Director Kent Rochford asking them to renew the group&#8217;s charter, set to run out 23 April. Instead, Sessions and DOJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/956146/download">announced on Monday</a> that the charter would be allowed to expire, and he requested proposals for a new advisory committee or an office within DOJ that would advance forensic science&#8212;a move many fear will exclude mainstream scientific views from future policy decisions.&#160;</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>Casadevall spoke to <cite>Science</cite>Insider about the commission&#8217;s value, its limitations, and what he expects to be its legacy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What was the logic behind this panel?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A: </strong>If you think about it, the techniques that formed forensic science were created to try to do criminal investigations. &#8230;&#160;Their ancestry is out of the mainstream of science, in the sense that they were developed for the purpose of trying to help solve crimes, and consequently, many of these techniques never got validated.&#160;&#8230; The big innovation of the commission was that you had mainstream scientists sitting at the table with judges, prosecutors, and forensic [practitioners]. &#8230; We [scientists] were there because science has traditions and approaches that transcend disciplines. Even though our domains are very different, our approaches to inquiry, our approaches to error, are pretty similar.</p>\n\n<p>The first five meetings of the commission, very little got done because we were trying even to learn to talk to one another. We come from completely different worlds. Law works as a dichotomy&#8212;you&#8217;re guilty or not guilty. In science, all knowledge is provisional. I assume that what we&#8217;re doing in my lab today is going to be overturned in the future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What do you see as the key products of the commission?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A: </strong>I think the document that was voted on in September [2016] stating that new techniques of forensic science need to be independently validated is a really important line in the sand. &#8230; Today, if you develop a new technique to characterize white powders, and you start a company, you can actually sell this to police departments without necessarily going through any [validation] mechanism &#8230; and then use it in court, in a situation in which the lawyers don&#8217;t know any of the science. So who is going to challenge any of this?</p>\n\n<p>The recommendation was that it should go to an independent entity that is not part of the justice department. &#8230;&#160;And to me, that is probably the single most important output of the committee. That at least is on record.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What about all the existing techniques that are still used in court and haven&#8217;t been validated, such as bite mark evidence?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Of course, we wanted [the document] to be bigger. We wanted it to be retrospective. But we had to compromise to get the votes. &#8230; We were a deliberative body and we need to get a product out, and if you dig your heels and say all of it needs to be independently validated, you couldn&#8217;t even get that statement.</p>\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t put the genie back in the bottle. The questions are out there. The Innocence Project, for example, is training lawyers on what questions to ask [about certain] techniques. We have an adversarial system. Inevitably, the pressure is going to come in, even from the prosecutors who say, &#8220;Hey guys, we&#8217;ve got to fix these techniques, because every time I present this, they hit me with these questions.&#8221; &#8230; There is a greater awareness now that if you&#8217;re going to introduce any of these things into court, you may be asked, &#8220;Where is your error rate? How do you really know what a match is? What does that mean?&#8221; I&#160;tend to look at this as progress.</p>\n\n<p>On Monday [at the commission&#8217;s final meeting], there were two documents that were voted down. &#8230; One of the documents was just to recommend that when somebody testified, if you asked them about an error rate, they should be able to tell you that they had it, or that they didn&#8217;t know. I think that if I stopped somebody on the street and I asked them, most people would agree that this is a reasonable thing. But some of the people &#8230;&#160;felt that this recommendation would be used by defense lawyers to question a lot of [forensic] practitioners. If we had continued to meet, those documents would have gone back to committee &#8230; and they would have figured out a way to work around &#8230; and they may have passed in the summer meeting or the fall meeting.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Did you expect the commission&#8217;s charter to be renewed?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A: </strong>The truth of the matter is we did not know. We knew it was a congressional charter and Congress had basically appropriated money to run the commission a certain number of cycles. We thought that with the new administration, there was a high probability that perhaps it didn&#8217;t get renewed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Why wouldn&#8217;t DOJ support continuing the commission?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Sessions&#8217;s statement doesn&#8217;t say anything bad about science. They basically say that we&#8217;re going to take this and we&#8217;re going to put it back in the Department of Justice, create a new office of forensic science. On the surface, that sounds good. You could imagine that they could create an office with a lot of scientific input. &#8230; The problem of forensic science is that it grew out of an arm of the judiciary, and by putting it back, you basically don&#8217;t deal with the questions that are being asked from mainstream science. &#8230; The commission was the only mechanism that existed where you had working scientists talking to people who actually do forensic science to generate data that is consumed by the legal system. And we were a minority.</p>\n\n<p>I served on the anthrax investigation&#8212;the National Academy of Sciences study that was done on [<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2008/09/fbi-request-scientific-review-its-anthrax-investigation">the 2001 anthrax mailings</a>]&#8212;so I can tell you that the culture of criminal justice feels very uncomfortable when you question their techniques. And that is natural. These people are trying to reduce crime by putting people away. And here you have a situation in which techniques that they have used for many, many years come into question, and I think there is natural instinct to say, &#8220;Oh, God.&#8221; Some of that may have been there. But there are also a lot of people who recognize that these problems aren&#8217;t going away. And the way to deal with this is to do the science.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Q&amp;A: The U.S. Department of Justice scrapped independent forensics panel, but the scientific questions &#8216;are not going away&#8217;" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

"You normally cannot hear me anyway," jokes the physicist at the start of a talk this past December at CERN, the particle physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, while a technician fiddles with his microphone.</p>\n\n<p>Ting may be soft-spoken, but few would call him retiring. Two decades ago, Ting persuaded funders to spend $1.5 billion to build the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS). In 2011, NASA launched the 8.5-metric-ton magnet on the penultimate space shuttle flight and attached it to the International Space Station (ISS). Now he is capturing attention again, with a hint&#8212;buried at the end of his talk&#8212;that the AMS is finally delivering on the promise of its original name, when "AM" stood for "antimatter."</p>\n\n<p>So far, the AMS has measured the masses and electric charges of some 90 billion particles that have passed through the magnet\'s maw. Nearly all of those are protons and helium nuclei, along with a smattering of electrons and nuclei of carbon, oxygen, and iron. A precious few are antiprotons and positrons: the antimatter counterparts of protons and electrons. To Ting, those antiparticles may be clues to the unseen "dark matter" that weighs down galaxies with extra gravity, although many astrophysicists regard them as the byproduct of humdrum galactic events.</p>\n\n<p>Those antiparticles are not Ting\'s big news, however. At CERN, and again in a 16 February talk at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, where he has worked since 1969, Ting says that the AMS may have trapped a bigger and weirder form of antimatter. The AMS, he says, has seen a handful of candidate particles of antihelium-3, made of two antiprotons and an antineutron. In labs on Earth, physicists have made antihelium for a few fleeting instants, but no one has ever detected it in space.</p>\n\n<p>"It was shocking," says physicist Michael Salamon, AMS project manager at the Department of Energy (DOE) in Washington, D.C., who heard about the results when Ting called him during a vacation. It\'s so unexpected that Ting says he has refrained from publishing the finding or even asking theorists what might be going on. "I want to make sure the signal is genuine," he tells <em>Science.</em> Detecting antihelium in nature could shake up cosmology. A single confirmed detection could indicate the existence of islands of antimatter that have survived since the big bang, or point to particle interactions beyond the standard model of physics. And for Ting, who turned 81 in January, it would be a vindication, a final retort to his strident critics.</p>\n\n<p>In 1976, Ting shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering a subatomic particle called the J/Psi meson. It was 1994 when he first proposed using the AMS to take the particle hunt to space. He promptly drew flak. Some contended that the project, funded by international partners and DOE, had won support through savvy political maneuvering instead of a normal scientific review, and that it wouldn\'t deliver big insights. Ting\'s results so far amount to "physics by press conference," says Greg Tarl&#233;, an astrophysicist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and a vocal critic of Ting and the AMS.</p>\n\n<p>Ting\'s marquee AMS result&#8212;that more high-energy positrons than expected are buzzing around the galaxy&#8212;has not impressed the doubters. That positron excess, which a European satellite found in the mid-2000s and the AMS confirmed, has sparked hundreds of theory papers connecting it to hypothetical dark matter particles. The mutual annihilation of those particles might create a half-and-half blend of electrons and positrons in a narrow energy range. The electrons would fade into a sea of electrons from other sources, but the rarer positrons might stand out. To Ting, the best explanation for the extra positrons is a dark matter particle with a mass of 1 teraelectronvolt&#8212;about as much energy as a flying mosquito.</p>\n\n<p>Other researchers favor more familiar astrophysical sources. The proliferation of dark matter models, including those that Ting points to, "maybe has more to do with communities and how fast they write papers than it does with science," says Tim Linden, a particle astrophysicist at The Ohio State University in Columbus. He and others note that the Milky Way is a messy laboratory, roiling with pulsars&#8212;the spinning, highly magnetic cores of collapsed stars&#8212;and supernovas, which accelerate protons to ultrahigh energies and send them slamming into cooler gas.

There are few conceivable ways for conventional astrophysical processes or dark matter particles to generate that much antihelium, says Kerstin Perez, a particle astrophysicist at MIT. She is co-leading a balloon experiment that could search for antihelium when it launches over Antarctica in 2020. "If it\'s real," she says of Ting\'s claim, "it\'s something fundamentally new."</p>\n\n<p>It also would validate Ting\'s original proposal. When Ting sold NASA and DOE on the AMS, he said it might find runaway particles from oases of antimatter, helping solve a deep riddle. The big bang produced matter and antimatter in equal amounts. Soon after, they began colliding and annihilating each other in puffs of gamma rays. But somehow, matter came to dominate the observable universe. That could be because of some fundamental difference between the two&#8212;or maybe it was just a coin flip, where certain regions of space came to be ruled by one or the other. Ting\'s idea to look for those regions galvanized his critics, who considered it outlandish because clumps of antimatter coexisting with normal galaxies would produce more gamma radiation than astronomers observe. Moreover, large antiparticles could not easily survive the journey to the AMS. But if antimatter were there, the AMS would sniff it out&#8212;or so the original pitch went.</p>\n\n<p>The feeling both inside and outside of the AMS team, though, is that it\'s still far too early to rule out a more mundane explanation: a problem in the detector. As charged particles pass through the doughnut-shaped magnet, its field bends their paths into signature curves that indicate their charge and momentum. The particles arc through nine cooled-down silicon detectors that track the curves. About a billion times a year the particle turns out to be a helium nucleus, with two positive charges. But each year has also brought one event or so that for all the world looks like it is curving with charge equal to minus two, Ting says&#8212;the expected signature of antihelium. The events could just be heliums bouncing unusually off an atom inside the experiment, leading to a misidentification. But the team has used computers to model all the possible paths a particle could take in the detector. "We still do not see any possible way this could come from any background," Ting says. "Many people in the collaboration think we should publish it."</p>\n\n<p>That he hasn\'t done so yet is typical of Ting, his supporters say. "That is kind of his trademark, so to speak , to be extremely sure when something comes out," says Philip von Doetinchem of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, who is a member of the AMS team but has not worked on the antihelium problem. But critics see it differently. "He knows that he has an instrumental problem," Tarl&#233; says. To Tarl&#233;, Ting is strategically playing coy to drum up further support for the mission.</p>\n\n<p>And Ting may need it. DOE, which will review the AMS in 2019, is impatient for breakthroughs&#8212;not routine astrophysics. "Understanding the spectra of particular species of cosmic rays is good to know, but it\'s not as important, quite frankly," Salamon says. A more pressing concern is that just one of four redundant pumps that cool its silicon trackers is working at full strength.</p>\n\n<p>If the AMS can last until 2024, when the United States and other nations plan to stop funding the ISS, the magnet should be able to double its census of particles. Achieving that would not only help differentiate between exotic and mundane interpretations of its positron signals but also could give Ting more antihelium candidates. Ting won\'t say whether having 10 or more will provide the statistical power required to call this a discovery, but he says each one helps.</p>\n\n<p>Ting says he is planning to replace the broken pumps with a new system that astronauts would install during a spacewalk. A NASA spokesperson confirms that planning for the repair is underway, in case the last pump breaks. The agency has devoted $16 million to possible spacewalks between now and 2019. DOE and Ting\'s international partners have already purchased the replacement parts, he says. "There\'s no money issue," Ting says.</p>\n\n<p>If, after all these years, the AMS falls short of finding antihelium, it won\'t be for lack of trying.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Giant space magnet may have trapped antihelium, raising idea of lingering pools of antimatter in the cosmos" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Slap it in front of a unit of concentration, such as molar, and it means that something exists in an extraordinarily small amount&#8212;think one part per quintillion. That&#8217;s the realm of SHERLOCK, a new diagnostic system that can detect attomolar levels of viruses in a sample and also distinguish Zika from its close relative, dengue. This exquisitely sensitive and specific tool promises to help detect diseases that other diagnostics miss, and it&#8217;s simple and cheap to use. Sexier still, it exploits a variation of CRISPR, the genome-editing method that has become the rage in biology.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very nice work and very well done,&#8221; says Erik Sontheimer, an RNA specialist who did early CRISPR work and is at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester. Harvard University&#8217;s George Church, who co-founded a CRISPR therapeutics company with one of SHERLOCK&#8217;s inventors but is not involved with this work, sums up his reaction in one word: &#8220;Wow.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Scientists recognized as early as 2010 that they might be able to transform CRISPR into a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2976250/">virus detection device</a>. But earlier efforts at making a viral detector became overshadowed by <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/topic/crispr">CRISPR&#8217;s wild success at editing genomes</a>. In those CRISPR applications, scientists fashion a short strip of RNA that guides a DNA-cutting enzyme called Cas9 to precise locations anywhere in a genome. The CRISPR-Cas9 scissors can cripple genes or make way for labs to add new DNA at the point of the cut, which has launched a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/how-battle-lines-over-crispr-were-drawn">billion-dollar industry</a> searching for new medicines and improved crops&#8212;and sparked serious <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/12/inside-summit-human-gene-editing-reporter-s-notebook">ethical debates</a> about the potential to enhance humans.</p>\n\n<p>SHERLOCK differs from the CRISPR-Cas9 system in fundamental ways. It uses an RNA guide that gloms onto RNA, not DNA, and an enzyme called Cas13a cuts the genetic material. Once Cas13a snips the target, it starts indiscriminately cutting any RNA it encounters. A team lead by bioengineer James Collins and CRISPR genome-editing pioneer Feng Zhang, both from the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has now shown that these &#8220;collateral&#8221; cuts can form the basis for the SHERLOCK diagnostic. &#8220;Nature has a lot of very amazing tools,&#8221; Zhang says. The researchers demonstrate that SHERLOCK can detect viral and bacterial infections, cancer mutations found at low frequencies, and subtle DNA sequence variations known as single nucleotide polymorphisms that are linked to other diseases. (SHERLOCK, a somewhat strained acronym coined by the team, stands for specific high sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking.)</p>\n\n<p>To exploit SHERLOCK for detecting small amounts of virus, the researchers spiked samples containing Zika or dengue virus with so-called fluorescent reporter RNA. When this RNA is cut, it effectively shoots off fluorescent flares. The team then unleashed Cas13a connected to a bit of RNA that targeted genetic sequences from either Zika or dengue. Once Cas13a found and sliced even a few viral sequences, it subsequently snipped the fluorescent reporters and created a detectable signal indicating the presence of the virus, the team <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aam9321">reports today</a> in <cite>Science</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers jiggered the system to also make it work on DNA targets&#8212;including cancer mutations in human genomes&#8212;by using enzymes that convert them to RNA. &#8220;It works great for both types of nucleic acid,&#8221; says Broad bioengineer and first author Jonathan Gootenberg, stressing that the real advantage of Cas13a is that it has the collateral activity and can trigger the fluorescent reporter.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;There are exciting opportunities to use such systems for diagnostics in the future,&#8221; says Jennifer Doudna, a structural biologist at the University of California (UC), Berkeley, who helped lead a team that <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6096/816.long">first showed</a> in 2012 how CRISPR-Cas9 could edit DNA. (UC is in a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/round-one-crispr-patent-legal-battle-goes-broad-institute">pitched patent battle</a> with the Broad over those initial discoveries.) In 2011, Doudna co-founded a company to focus on creating diagnostics with CRISPR&#8212;it was <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=9260752&amp;OS=9260752&amp;RS=9260752">awarded a patent</a> for this&#8212;but it now mainly pursues genome engineering. A study Doudna co-authored that <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v538/n7624/full/nature19802.html">appeared last year</a> in <em>Nature </em>described how Cas13 could be used as a sensitive detection system with a fluorescent RNA reporter, but it did not go into the detail of the new work. &#8220;It&#8217;s gratifying to see that this new paper builds on our core idea of using [Cas13] to detect transcripts, and that our results were so helpful to their engineering efforts,&#8221; she says.</p>\n\n<p>The detection sensitivity of the new CRISPR-Cas13a system for specific genetic material is 1 million times better than the most commonly used diagnostic technique, which detects proteins and is known in shorthand as ELISA. It&#8217;s also 1000 times more sensitive than a CRISPR-based Zika virus diagnostic the Collins lab described last year in a <a href="http://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)30505-0"><cite>Cell</cite> paper</a>. SHERLOCK not only makes it easier to find infections or cancer mutations that less sensitive diagnostics can miss, says Collins, but the remarkable attomolar detection ability means the test works far more quickly, too.</p>\n\n<p>A SHERLOCK diagnostic that puts the needed chemicals on a piece of glass fiber paper can be quickly designed for most any RNA or DNA target, made rugged enough for field use, and could cost as little as 61 cents per test, say the study&#8217;s authors. This could greatly help during outbreaks of new infectious diseases, which often occur in poor countries and are difficult to accurately diagnose.</p>\n\n<p>Collins says the Broad is now &#8220;aggressively exploring&#8221; how to commercialize SHERLOCK and may launch a startup company. But before a diagnostic comes to market, it must pass muster at regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="New CRISPR tool can detect tiny amounts of viruses" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Aboriginal woman, of the Dunghutti and Bundjalung peoples. I heard about the March for Science through Twitter and then one of the organizers invited me to join the Australian organizing committee. I see it as an opportunity to bridge the science and Aboriginal Australian communities.</p>\n              <p>Aboriginal Australian cultures are rich in science, having developed over 65,000 years a knowledge of natural, ecological sustainability that was applied to our own lands. These methodologies are now important for bushlands that need vegetation and renewal, and they could be applied to Australian national parks and marine areas.</p>\n              <p>The march is important at several levels: I&#8217;m from a small town and there is a big movement back home to promote natural and sustainable farming in response to the trend toward big-business agriculture. The local river runs into the ocean, carrying run-off pollution that has caused algal blooms. At the national level, there is the Great Barrier Reef, where shipping and overfishing are killing the ocean and Australian marine biodiversity. Internationally, there is a domino effect in which the policies of the United States will influence policies here. For example, coal mining is also big in Australia, and those promoting mining are not looking into the environmental impact it will have over the next 50 years.</p>\n              <p>We need to be more inclusive in science. We should promote awareness of Aboriginal Australians&#8217; views and encourage all Aboriginal peoples interested in a science career to study and go for it. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/dennis-normile">Dennis Normile</a></i></p>\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Australia_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header black">Australia</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/18_cc_AUSTRALIA---Stuart-Khan-1_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Stuart Kahn</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p class="black">We&#8217;re up to about 10 marches</p>\n                    <footer class="black">Stuart Khan, 45, environmental engineer specializing in chemical contaminants in water at University of New South Wales in Sydney </footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I first heard of the March for Science through social media. We noticed a couple of march sites that started up in the United States. The response in Australia has not been as substantial as in the U.S., but I think it has been positive and relatively strong. We&#8217;re a bit disappointed that the big science associations are not participating. But we are up to about 10 marches. As for participation, we&#8217;ll find out on 22 April. If it doesn&#8217;t rain, we might have a few thousand in each city.</p>\n              <p>I have long been concerned about the alarmingly low level of appreciation for science exhibited by politicians in Australia as well as in other countries. I firmly believe that an improved appreciation for science holds the key to all of the great challenges we currently face. It&#8217;s not just climate change; the antivaccination and anti&#8211;water fluoridation movements are fairly big here. There is a general lack of trust in and respect for what science can tell us; people don&#8217;t know how much faith to put into science. If the science doesn&#8217;t suit their preconceived beliefs, people feel open to alternatives.</p>\n              <p>Science is very global. I collaborate with people in other countries every day, use data developed by other research groups, and make knowledge and information available to others. If science suffers in one country, the whole system suffers. Especially if that country has been contributing as much as the U.S. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/dennis-normile">Dennis Normile</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Austria">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Austria_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header black">Austria</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/19_cc_AUSTRIA---Renee-Schroeder_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Stefan Knittel</p>\n                <div class="card-text austria">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote black">\n                    <p class="black">Science has always had open borders</p>\n                    <footer class="black">Ren&#233;e Schroeder, 63, biochemist at the Max Perutz Laboratories in Vienna</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>On 22 April I would normally have been at a retreat with about 100 other scientists of our research project on RNA biology. But I was contacted by Oliver Lehman, the organizer of the march here in Vienna, and we have decided to skip lunch and cut the retreat short so that we can all take part in the March for Science.</p>\n              <p>It&#8217;s important to advocate for science. Antienlightenment sentiments are rising worldwide. Many Austrians are against genetic engineering but don&#8217;t know what a gene is, for instance. I have a problem with that. It&#8217;s almost fashionable to be against science nowadays.</p>\n              <p>But this march is part of a global movement that has really gained momentum after Trump&#8217;s inauguration. We had a similar situation here in Austria last year. There was a lot of fear that the populist Norbert Hofer would win the presidential elections, but a movement for enlightenment and tolerance, full of optimism, sprang up. This march feels like a continuation of that, and like science itself, it is international. Science has always had open borders, more so than nation states.</p>\n              <p>I think the march will be fairly big. We&#8217;re still discussing what signs we want to make. There will be tables set out along the route where people can do experiments and scientists can engage with the public. Saturday afternoon is a good time because there will be lots of people in the city. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/kai-kupferschmidt">Kai Kupferschmidt</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Germany">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Germany_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header black">Germany</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/11_cc_GERMANY---Martin-Stratmann_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Axel Griesch</p>\n                <div class="card-text germany">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p class="black">This is not a march against Trump</p>\n                    <footer class="black">Martin Stratmann, 62, electrochemist and president of Max Planck Society in Munich </footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>The last and only time I went to a protest was as a pupil. This was around 1968, and we were marching to change the school system, which was too hierarchical. This time I am marching for two reasons: One is that the employees at the Max Planck Society, the Ph.D. students, the directors, will be happy to see their president showing his support for the movement. And I have a strong personal motivation: Today, science is more important than ever before, but evidence and knowledge are being questioned in many places, including politics. Like many people, I have been following the political developments in the last 18 months with great concern. </p>\n              <p>This is a march pro-science and pro-facts, not a march against Trump. Of course, in the U.S., Trump has come to symbolize how little facts and evidence are currently being valued in politics, and that scientific freedom is restricted in part because results are politically inconvenient. But we face the same concerns in Europe; for example, a leading university is under threat in Hungary. In addition, the Max Planck Society has employees from all over the world&#8212;including from Iran, China, and Turkey. Many of these researchers know how science is restricted in their countries of origin. And that is often connected with restrictions of freedom in general. They want to say clearly that science should be free everywhere, that people should be free everywhere.</p>\n              <p>I expect the march in Munich to be very diverse. It&#8217;s a cosmopolitan city that has the highest density of science in Germany. I think that younger people especially will take the opportunity to march for their future. They will face the consequences of our global problems in their lifetimes. We have to spell out to society that we cannot solve these problems without science. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/kai-kupferschmidt">Kai Kupferschmidt</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Greenland">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Greenland_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Greenland</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/3_cc_GREENLAND----Michael-MacFerrin_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Horst Machguth</p>\n                <div class="card-text greenland">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>It will be a powerful image from this remote corner that people care</p>\n                    <footer>Mike MacFerrin, 37, graduate student in glaciology at the University of Colorado in Boulder </footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I decided early on that I would really like to go to the March for Science. I figured I could use some airline miles to get to D.C. Because I&#8217;m a field glaciologist, I was going to bring my parka, Baffin boots, and ski goggles. When the date was announced, I realized I was going to be in Greenland. Then about 3 minutes later, I realized there wasn&#8217;t any reason we couldn&#8217;t do it there. </p>\n              <p>Several other teams will be there, many from Europe, staging in Kangerlussuaq, a town of maybe 600 people. It has the main airport in Greenland; roughly half the town is employed by the airport. I got in touch with Nini Frydkj&#230;r Holstebro, a Greenlander and a friend, to make sure that local officials were OK with it. She&#8217;s a small business owner and a pillar of the community. </p>\n              <p>Due to the recent political turmoil here in the United States, I&#8217;ve become more active politically in the last year than I ever was in my life. Science in our country&#8212;and we&#8217;re not the only place&#8212;is coming under attack. Scientists are being portrayed as nefarious people. I work on a project funded by NASA&#8217;s Cryospheric Sciences Program, part of NASA&#8217;s earth science division. Trump recently proposed cuts to the division&#8212;at a really crucial time.</p>\n              <p> The changes we&#8217;re seeing in Greenland are dramatic. People in Kangerlussuaq have a reason to care. A bridge partly washed out in 2012, due to runoff from the ice sheet. I liken the attacks on science to turning off the headlights. We&#8217;re driving fast and people don&#8217;t want to see what&#8217;s coming up. Scientists&#8212;we&#8217;re the headlights. </p>\n              <p>I&#8217;ve spent a couple hundred dollars of my own money on a 12-foot banner. It says &#8220;March for Science, Greenland. Science not Silence.&#8221; I plan to put up signs around town. We&#8217;ll invite anyone who wants to come. We&#8217;ll walk from the port station to the bridge. It will be like three blocks. Then we&#8217;ll drive out to the ice sheet and get some photos. Our march is just one of many, but it will be a powerful image from this remote corner that people care. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/erik-stokstad">Erik Stokstad</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Iceland">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Iceland_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Iceland</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/9_ICELAND%20Erna_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Kristinn Ingvarsson, University of Iceland</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>This is one of the biggest things we&#8217;ve done for science in Iceland</p>\n                    <footer>Erna Magn&#250;sd&#243;ttir, 43, molecular biologist at the University of Iceland in Reykjavik and president of the Iceland Academy of Sciences</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>This is one of the biggest things we&#8217;ve done for science in Iceland. We&#8217;re going to march from a hill called Sk&#243;lav&#246;r&#240;uholt where there is a statue of Leif Erikson. That&#8217;s a bit symbolic. He discovered America, and now America is in trouble. We&#8217;re walking half a kilometer down to the center of the city. We&#8217;ll have a seminar with three speakers, talking about public policy and funding issues in Iceland. An American sociologist will tell us about the atmosphere in America.</p>\n              <p>We got the idea for the march just after the Trump administration took over. We saw a disregard for science. People got very scared for the future of the planet. First of all, it&#8217;s the issue of what the Trump administration will do about global warming.</p>\n              <p>It&#8217;s also the idea of informed policy, of evidence-based policies. We have to fight for that here in Iceland, like everywhere. Politicians use evidence when it fits their views. We feel like we&#8217;re shunned when it does not suit them. And we&#8217;re really struggling and fighting for proper funding of science. They&#8217;re cutting some of the competitive funds. We need 60% more funding to reach the average of [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] countries. This is not a very ambitious goal for a rich country.</p>\n              <p>The person leading the march, &#198;var &#222;or Benediktsson, is a bit of a TV celebrity here. He hosts a show for children about science and he also has a radio program. He&#8217;s a very positive, fun guy. One of the goals is to get people involved, to get them to think about science. Everyone should feel like they are part of science. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/erik-stokstad">Erik Stokstad</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Italy">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Italy_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Italy</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/8_cc_ValenteRdJ_16x9_0.jpg"><p class="credit">Courtesy Marco Valente</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>We feel there is a lack of respect towards academia</p>\n                    <footer>Marco Valente, 53, teaches Economics at the University of L&#8217;Aquila</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I am a member of a network of university researchers that promotes better policies for public universities and fights research cuts. When we learned about the March for Science in the United States, we thought we had good reasons to join them. Science is being challenged in Italy as well; scientific evidence is questioned, and it is often distorted for political needs. The way the Xylella fastidiosa outbreak in olive trees in southern Italy was handled; the vaccine debate, with the dramatic drop of vaccination rates; or the infamous Stamina case, where an unproven therapy was tested on humans due to media pressure, are good examples. Newspapers and political parties often depict science, research, and professors in negative terms. We feel there is a lack of respect towards academia. Many people don&#8217;t know how much authority to attribute to various sources of information.</p>\n              <p>We will participate in the march without any affiliation to specific groups and without a specific platform of demands. We just want to engage public opinion on the risk of losing scientific objectivity. Many people are letting us know they will support us, and we are beginning to receive the support of [nongovernmental organizations], universities, and research centers. </p>\n              <p>What do we expect? That people understand the difference between a scientific debate and a debate about the future of society. As an academic, I would also expect politicians to trust us more. For at least 10 years, politicians have only produced repressive policies for universities. They don&#8217;t see academia as a promoter of knowledge but as a teaching institution. Finally, we&#8217;d like to see more attention towards global warming, with effective policies and more pressure on the U.S. to force them to change their position. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/luca-tancredi-barone">Luca Tancredi Barone</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Japan">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Japan_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Japan</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/10_cc_JAPAN---Rintaro-Mori_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Courtesy Rintaro Mori </p>\n                <div class="card-text japan">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>Science provides an objective view that is important for decision-making</p>\n                    <footer>Rintaro Mori, 46, medical doctor and public health epidemiologist at the National Center for Child Health and Development in Tokyo and director of Cochrane Japan</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>This is the first time I have been involved in such an activity. I have a huge concern and also have professional and academic interests in the sustainability of our global society. I believe the scientific community has a very important role to address issues honestly, even challenging taboos, to provide objective information so as to achieve sustainable development. We&#8217;re not advocating for funding. Rather, science provides an objective view that is important for decision-making. Too many decisions are biased by vested interests, and this is leading our society in a wrong way. I think the march is a very good opportunity to help the general public recognize this important role of the scientific community.</p>\n              <p>One interesting phenomenon in this context is the use of the human papillomavirus vaccine. This is standard in many countries but Japan is well behind because of a series of events that created adverse publicity. The government has not been able to make a decision. The scientific community can help. </p>\n              <p>Cochrane is one of the organizations supporting the March for Science. I don&#8217;t think the march is very prominent in the Japanese community yet. I am discussing how we are going to participate with my colleagues. We are still waiting for approval from the police department. (There was a delay in applying for march permits.) There should be no problem. But without that we cannot circulate information about what we are doing.

Another group was already organizing a march for science down Reforma Avenue, but I have had no luck getting in touch with them. So the academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine got together and decided to organize a parallel rally outside of the Palacio de Miner&#237;a, a landmark colonial building downtown that used to be an engineering school.</p>\n              <p>At first the main motivation was Donald Trump&#8217;s policies, especially about immigration. Limitations on visas could affect thousands of Mexican students and researchers, even those who simply want to attend a scientific meeting in the U.S. Maintaining international collaborations and openness benefits everyone. The fact that the U.S. has been able to attract the best students from around the world has been a source of strength and richness for the country. Mexico has more students in the U.S. than in any other country, and we also have many engineers working at NASA, for example.</p>\n              <p>But as the organizing has gone on, we&#8217;ve realized we don&#8217;t want to focus too much on Trump. We want to send a larger message about how important science is for Mexico&#8217;s economic development and how it can create change in our country</p>\n              <p>There isn&#8217;t a long history of activism for science in Mexico. Political protests happen all the time in Mexico City, and they don&#8217;t seem to change anything. Many people here don&#8217;t see the point of marching for anything anymore. Our challenge is to overcome people&#8217;s apathy and convince them to participate in this one, which we hope will be part of a global movement. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/lizzie-wade">Lizzie Wade</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Netherlands">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Netherlands_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Netherlands</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/12_cc_NETHERLANDS---Karen-Maex-%282%29_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">UvA</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>I&#8217;m in.

Absolutely. Academic freedom is one of the most important issues to me, and recent developments in Europe have threatened it. The Hungarian government has signed a decree that targets and silences Central European University. I don&#8217;t need to tell you that many academics in Turkey have been arrested and detained. I find that very worrisome. I&#8217;m concerned about the United States as well. Climate science is often sidelined without proper arguments and people promote &#8216;alternative facts&#8217; that have no basis in academic research. Of course there are issues in the Netherlands as well, but they&#8217;re a different order of magnitude.</p>\n              <p>I&#8217;m not the type of rector to start recruiting people for the march. This is not something that should come from the board; people can make up their own minds. But I know the issue is very widely discussed, and I think there will be a big delegation from our university, both students and staff. I know that rectors of several other universities are joining as well. This is something that the academic community in the Netherlands feels strongly about and we hope to send a clear message. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/martin-enserink">Martin Enserink</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="NewZealand">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/NewZealand_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">New Zealand</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/1_cc_NEW-ZELAND---Craig-Stevens_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Aitana Forc&#233;n-V&#225;zquez</p>\n                <div class="card-text newzealand">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>Trump was the thing that initiated it</p>\n                    <footer>Craig Stevens, physical oceanographer at the University of Auckland, president of the New Zealand Association of Scientists</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>Because of the time difference, we were the first place in the world to march for women and we can be the first to march for scientists. We expect to have three or four marches around the country. Mind you, we are a country of just 3 to 4 million, with 11,000 scientists and an equal number of research students. And the march is not just for scientists; anyone who values science can participate. I&#8217;m going to be a speaker. I&#8217;m tentatively scheduled to talk at the Wellington march, but it&#8217;s not coming together as strongly as the one in Auckland, so I might go up to there.</p>\n              <p>Trump was the thing that initiated it; we even put out a press release about his election. We have issues here but if it were not for the new U.S. administration, they would not have been enough to get us into the streets. As president of the society, we advocate for science and reject pseudoscience. We try to inject science into policy. We are a small player, so we depend on results from the rest of the world. There&#8217;s a big concern that if there&#8217;s an overall downturn in science, it will embolden people locally and internationally to cease to value the view of science.</p>\n              <p>For New Zealand, this march comes at a good time. This is an election year and the march puts science more firmly in the political picture. It will raise the appreciation of science. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/elizabeth-pennisi">Elizabeth Pennisi</a></i></p>\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/NewZealand_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">New Zealand</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/13_NEW%20ZEALAND%20Nicola%20Gaston_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Colin MacDiarmid</p>\n                <div class="card-text newzealand2">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>I feel everyone should know about it</p>\n                    <footer>Nicola Gaston, physicist at the University of Auckland; helped organize the March for Science in New Zealand, but will be in the United States on 22 April and hopes to march in Washington, D.C.</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I am planning to march because I believe in society. We need to stand up for things we believe in, whether that is science, knowledge, or the value of evidence-based policy and informed democratic discourse. I feel like everyone should know about it, but the reality is that many New Zealanders have more important things to worry about than the status of science!</p>\n              <p>Because science careers are often international, we need to stand in solidarity with our colleagues in the U.S. who are affected by the politicization of science and loss of funding. But even more than that, I am concerned with the dismissal of scientific and other forms of knowledge as the basis for rational conversation, and ultimately agreement within society. In New Zealand, former Prime Minister <a href="http://www.noted.co.nz/archive/listener-nz-2011/john-keys-unhappy-week-at-the-bbc/" target="_blank">John Key famously said about scientist Mike Joy</a>, who has raised concern about the impact of the dairy industry on freshwater quality, &#8216;He&#8217;s one academic, and like lawyers, I can provide you with another one that will give you a counter view.&#8217;</p>\n              <p>After the march is over, I think we are going to see a lot more soul searching within the scientific community about the purpose of a march, whether it has achieved anything, and whether more collective action, perhaps internationally, is necessary in order to make progress on the issues that have been raised. One of the big issues is the issue of diversity in the scientific community, which is being widely discussed using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/marginsci?lang=en" target="_blank">#marginsci</a>. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/elizabeth-pennisi">Elizabeth Pennisi</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Norway">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Norway_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Norway</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/15_cc_NORWAY---Annette-Bayer_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Stefan Amlie/UiT </p>\n                <div class="card-text norway">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>This may be the most northern March for Science</p>\n                    <footer>Annette Bayer, 45, chemist at the Arctic University of Norway in Troms&#248;</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I think this may be the most northern March for Science. It will start at one of the research institutes and go through the city center. In April, the weather in Troms&#248; can be everything from snow, to rain, to sun. I have a feeling that people are determined to attend. The Norwegians in general are not very sensitive to weather. We say, &#8216;There&#8217;s never bad weather, only bad clothing.&#8217;</p>\n              <p>My first reaction was that I wanted to participate to support my colleagues in the U.S. When I thought more about it, I realized it&#8217;s not just in the U.S.; supporting and recognizing the importance of knowledge is a global issue. There are issues in Norway related to resources, particularly oil and fisheries. If you want to use resources sustainably, it&#8217;s important to base your decision on knowledge.</p>\n              <p>It will be the first demonstration I have ever participated in. I think it&#8217;s really important that people understand that most scientists work for the benefit of all of us. At the moment, my colleagues and I are doing research in the field of using [carbon dioxide] as a carbon source to make drugs, fuels, and plastics, instead of using oil. The other topic we work on is antibiotic resistance. It&#8217;s a good example of how ignoring knowledge can have important consequences for global health.</p>\n              <p>There are marches all over the world. It would be very nice if that would encourage politicians as well as industrial leaders to really make decisions based on facts and not belief. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/erik-stokstad">Erik Stokstad</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Poland">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Poland_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Poland</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/17_POLAND---Justyna-Wojniak_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Justyna Wojniak</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>We are planning a day filled with small events</p>\n                    <footer>Justyna Wojniak, 38, educational policy researcher at the Pedagogical University of Krak&#243;w and spokesperson for the Polish Women Scientists Network</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>This is the first march the network participates in. The Polish march has not been organized as an action against Donald Trump, although his international policy certainly worries us. In Poland, we are facing many other issues of concern. The right-wing government and conservative majority in the Parliament have introduced several changes to the legal system and new regulations for public institutions that many Polish people perceive as a serious threat to democracy.</p>\n              <p>In the field of science, the government recently announced serious changes to the university system without widely consulting the scientific community. The main goal, it seems, is to make the university an entrepreneurial institution driven by market rules, competition, flexible employment, and cooperation with industry. There is now pressure and censorship on researchers in the social sciences and humanities to favor conservative and religious ideology. Polish science has other problems as well. It lacks a transparent granting system, a simple academic career path, and clear rules for promotion.</p>\n              <p>We are planning a day filled with small events at different locations in Warsaw, including a lecture on the role of science in politics and society, workshops, and scientific caf&#233;s. We hope that the informal atmosphere will enable the public to feel that they are touching science and that science really matters in their everyday lives. We would also like to be heard and treated seriously by the minister of science and higher education. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/elisabeth-pain">Elizabeth Pain</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Portugal">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Portugal_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Portugal</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/4_PORTUGAL---Carlos-Moedas_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">European Union, 2017/Nicolas Kovarik</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>Science is not a dispensable luxury</p>\n                    <footer>Carlos Moedas, European commissioner for research, science and innovation in Brussels.</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I&#8217;m really proud that the call for the March for Science resonated in so many countries and that a march is organized in my home country, Portugal.

We need science for the advancement of our societies and to inform our education, improve our policies, and spur innovation. Science, as a common good, also helps all of us to make sense of and navigate the more and more complex world we live in. So when special interests threaten scientific evidence and long-term research and when access to and diffusion of science is hampered, we have to stand up in support of the scientific community.</p>\n              <p>As the EU commissioner for research, science and innovation, I&#8217;m very proud to stand up for science and join the march in Lisbon. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/elisabeth-pain">Elizabeth Pain</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Spain">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Spain_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header black">Spain</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/14_ccEP_SPAIN---Nazario-Marti%CC%81n-Leo%CC%81n_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Courtesy of Nazario Mart&#237;n</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p class="black">The global and local issues go hand in hand</p>\n                    <footer class="black">Nazario Mart&#237;n, organic chemist at the Complutense University of Madrid and president of the Confederation of Scientific Societies of Spain (COSCE)</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I have marched for science in the past, but this march is pretty unique because it originated in the United States in response to the denial of demonstrated scientific facts like evolution and global warming by Trump and his cabinet. This is no joke: It represents a threat for science and could affect the health and the future of our planet. Countries in Europe are reacting to this tsunami from the United States by defending science not only globally but also within their own national context. The global and local issues go hand in hand.</p>\n              <p>In Spain, the situation is worrying because our political leadership shows no interest in empowering science. The government budget for 2017 represents a 2.6% decrease for research projects and institutions. The National Research Agency that the scientific community had been demanding for years is now starting operations, but it lacks the multiyear funding and scientific independence that were originally promised. All in all, we demand more financial support for research but also a better representation of science in politics.</p>\n              <p>There isn&#8217;t much of a tradition of marches and protests among Spanish scientists, so at COSCE we launched a manifesto for science, in the hope to make up for a possible lack of physical support in Madrid on 22 April. We will be meeting representatives of the Spanish Parliament on 26 April and it would be great if we could gather the signatures of several thousands of scientists. I am also hoping that the public realizes the importance of science for social progress and welfare, and will join the march and the manifesto. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/elisabeth-pain">Elizabeth Pain</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="SouthKorea">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/SouthKorea_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header black">South Korea</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/2_cc_SOUTH-KOREA---Eun-Kyoung-Jee_16x9.jpg?itok=shWCKHOp"><p class="credit">Courtesy Eun-Kyoung Jee</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p class="black">We will highlight the need for more women scientists and engineers</p>\n                    <footer class="black">Eun-Kyoung Jee, first-year graduate student in chemistry at Pohang University of Science and Technology </footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I have an interest in communication between scientists and the public.

We have people who reject using chemical products such as bleach, detergent, and toothpaste. We say they have &#8216;chemophobia.&#8217; It&#8217;s similar to the antivaccine feelings in the United States. I have a concern about this because my major is chemistry. I am also really concerned that the divide between science and the public will become more vast under Trump&#8217;s administration.

The environment is not favorable for women. There are numerous inequalities and inconveniences. There are even fewer toilets for women in science and engineering buildings. Our goals are to talk about this and make an environment that is equal. Maybe 16 or 17 members of Femicircuit will participate, and we&#8217;ll have an information booth to highlight the need for more women scientists and engineers. The March for Science is occurring all over the world, and we are trying to make participants here feel they are part of a global effort. &#8212;<i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/dennis-normile">Dennis Normile</a></i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class="timeline_item" id="Uganda">\n              <div class="march-card">\n                <img class="card-loc" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/Uganda_flag.jpg"><h2 class="card-header">Uganda</h2>\n                <img class="card-img" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/7_cc_UGANDA---Clet-Wandui-Masiga_16x9.jpg"><p class="credit">Tropical Institute of Development Innovations</p>\n                <div class="card-text">\n                  <blockquote class="pullquote card-quote">\n                    <p>Everyone is upbeat and excited about the event</p>\n                    <footer>Clet Wandui Masiga, 41, plant and livestock geneticist at the Tropical Institute of Development Innovations in Entebbe</footer>\n</blockquote>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n              <p>I evaluate biotechnology that might be developed in Uganda, mostly plant varieties.

We are going to carry placards with information on how science has been useful, and some of the tools that we no longer think we need to use, like the hand hoe. We have other technology like genetically engineered crops that are resistant to herbicides. We don&#8217;t want this hoe. It is breaking our backs. We will carry all the old models of phones. We will carry herbal medicine.</p>\n              <p>When we get to the Parliament, one of us will read a petition. We have requested that the speaker of the Parliament talk to us about the government&#8217;s position on science and technology. They should pass the National Biotechnology and Biosafety Bill. That will allow the government to regulate genetically engineered crops in a manner that is safe. </p>\n              <p>We are going to have farmers, professionals, civil servants, and politicians in the march. When we contacted the police for clearance, they said police officers can also participate, because it is nonpolitical. The police have a brass band. A band is very good at mobilizing people.

It&#8217;s time to place your bets, for NASA&#8217;s Cassini spacecraft, which has spent the past 13 years exploring the planet and its moons, is finally swooping close enough to take a look.</p>\n\n<p>On 26 April, it will thread the gap between the gas giant and its rings in the first of 22 week-long orbits that will culminate in September with a fiery and fatal plunge into the atmosphere. The Grand Finale, as NASA is calling the forays, should help answer questions about Saturn&#8217;s atmosphere and interior. But most of all, it should end a debate about the mass of the water ice rings, which is a big clue to their age&#8212;whether they are 4.5 billion years old, nearly as old as the planet, or much younger. The Cassini team has a betting pool on the mass: $5 a wager, due before the first orbit.</p>\n\n<p>The route will be dangerous. The gap contains ice particles finer than soot, which ought not to harm the spacecraft. But if the models are wrong, and Cassini collides at 122,000 kilometers per hour with something even as large as a BB, the mission will end early. &#8220;This is something we wouldn&#8217;t want to try at another time,&#8221; says Earl Maize, the Cassini program manager at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) in Pasadena, California. To be cautious, on its first pass, Cassini will hide behind its large antenna, using it as a shield to protect its instruments.</p>\n\n<p>As the spacecraft plunges toward the rings in subsequent orbits, a radio telescope in Argentina will be listening for tiny Doppler shifts in Cassini&#8217;s signal. Those will allow the team to tease out the gravitational pull of the rings from that of Saturn&#8212;a distinction that could not be made when Cassini was orbiting outside the rings, says Luciano Iess, a planetary scientist at the Sapienza University of Rome. The measurement could provide a verdict on the rings&#8217; mass&#8212;and their age.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, many scientists have assumed that the rings are nearly as old as Saturn itself&#8212;massive structures formed of icy planetary building blocks. Early on, Cassini showed the B ring, one of four main rings, to be bright and nearly opaque, bolstering the view that the ice particles are dense and that the rings have a total mass greater than Saturn&#8217;s 400-kilometer-wide moon, Mimas.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="figure__minimal entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-related-articles align-right"><article class="media media--var media--priority-2"><div class="media__icon">\n        \n  \n      <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/food-microbes-abundant-enceladus"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.sciencemag.org//www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/grid_thumb_-_290x163__16_9_/public/4852_PIA11688_1280x720.jpg?itok=lNtM6FkI" alt="An image of Enceladus plumes"></a>  \n      </div>\n    \n    <div class="media__body">\n              <h3 class="overline"></h3>\n      \n\n      \n      <h2 class="media__headline">\n        <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/food-microbes-abundant-enceladus">Food for microbes abundant on Enceladus</a>\n      </h2>\n          </div>\n  </article></figure><p>But an alternate view is gaining credence: that the rings are more delicate structures formed within the last 100 million years from the smashed ice of a lost moon. An age of 4.5 billion years is hard to reconcile with their pristine color, because a steady stream of sooty micrometeoroids from interplanetary space should have darkened them by now, like drops of black ink spreading in a pool of white paint. Moreover, the spacing between rippling, spiral waves within the rings, created by gravitational resonances with Saturn&#8217;s moons, can offer another clue to mass, and judging from a handful of wavelets recently spied within the bright B ring, it is low. Iess believes the total mass of the rings to be just 20% to 80% of Mimas.</p>\n\n<p>Cassini may reveal another clue when its close passage gives it the best view yet of the interior C and D rings. Amid the C ring&#8217;s icy particles, there are hints of larger chunks of rubble, says Jeff Cuzzi, a ring specialist at NASA&#8217;s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, who believes the rings are young. &#8220;This could even be the core of the object that formed the rings.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>By catching stray ring particles, the spacecraft could also learn more about the makeup of the rings themselves, which are at least 90% water ice. Their distinctive shade of taupe could come from reddish iron oxide or carotene, the orange of carrots.</p>\n\n<p>As the spacecraft&#8217;s orbits take it ever closer to Saturn itself, it will shift its attention from the rings to the planet&#8217;s roiling ammonia clouds. Its cameras should see the structure of storms, and shadows could reveal the architecture of sharp lines of clouds that may extend for several thousand kilometers. Close-up measurements of the planet&#8217;s magnetic field could finally reveal the length of a day on Saturn. With no solid surface to define a day, scientists hope to use periodic patterns in Saturn&#8217;s magnetic field to get at the rotation of its interior.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in the last five orbits, &#8220;we&#8217;re going to dip our toe into the atmosphere of Saturn,&#8221; says Linda Spilker, the Cassini project scientist at JPL. It will be the first time humanity has sampled the atmosphere of a gas giant since the Galileo spacecraft dropped a probe into Jupiter in 1995. If they get lucky, researchers could estimate the abundances of helium and hydrogen in Saturn&#8217;s outer layers, which, in turn, could help illuminate its interior structure and how gas giants form.</p>\n\n<p>On its final dive into Saturn, on 15 September, Cassini will point its antenna to Earth, but the spacecraft should go silent quickly, vaporizing within 3 minutes. Planners deemed it necessary to destroy Cassini rather than leave it wandering near Saturn because it may carry stowaway terrestrial microbes that could contaminate two Saturn moons, Titan and Enceladus, that have potentially habitable conditions.</p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s much to do before then. Cuzzi, though he favors youthful, low-mass rings, hasn&#8217;t gotten his bet into the pool yet. He&#8217;s waiting until the last minute. &#8220;I know time is getting short.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="In mission\'s last hurrah, Cassini aims to solve riddle of Saturn\'s rings" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Writing a good proposal can take months, and the chances of getting funded are often slim. Funding agencies, meanwhile, spend more and more time and money reviewing growing stacks of applications.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why two researchers are proposing a radically different system that would do away with applications and reviews; instead scientists would just give each other money. &#8220;Self-organized fund allocation&#8221; (SOFA), as it&#8217;s called, was developed by computer scientist Johan Bollen at Indiana University in Bloomington. When he first published about the idea in 2014, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6171/598">many people were skeptical</a>. But interest appears to be growing, and thanks to the work of an enthusiastic advocate, ecologist Marten Scheffer of Wageningen University in the Netherlands, the Dutch parliament adopted a motion last year asking the country&#8217;s main funding agency, the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), to set up a SOFA pilot project.</p>\n\n<p>Competition for funding has become too intense, especially for young scientists, Scheffer and Bollen say, and the current peer-review system is inefficient. It&#8217;s also unfair, they argue, because a few scientists get lots of grants&#8212;Scheffer is one of them&#8212;whereas many others get few or nothing. But when Scheffer explained his idea at an NWO workshop about &#8220;application pressure&#8221; here last week, the agency didn&#8217;t appear sold yet.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>The duo says the numbers speak for themselves. At the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the overall success rate for grants applications has dropped from 30% in 2003 to 19.1% in 2016. In the latest round of European Research Council Starting Grants, the rate was a paltry 11.3%. At NWO, the success rate for grants for young scientists has dropped to 14%. A 2013 study estimated that writing and reviewing applications for &#8364;40 million worth of these grants costs &#8364;9.5 million annually.</p>\n\n<p>In Bollen&#8217;s system, scientists no longer have to apply; instead, they all receive an equal share of the funding budget annually&#8212;some &#8364;30,000 in the Netherlands, and $100,000 in the United States&#8212;but they have to donate a fixed percentage to other scientists whose work they respect and find important. &#8220;Our system is not based on committees&#8217; judgments, but on the wisdom of the crowd,&#8221; Scheffer told the meeting.</p>\n\n<p>Bollen and his colleagues have tested their idea in computer simulations. If scientists allocated 50% of their money to colleagues they cite in their papers, research funds would roughly be distributed the way funding agencies currently do, <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-016-2110-3">they showed in a paper last year</a>&#8212;but at much lower overhead costs.</p>\n\n<p>Not everybody is convinced. At the meeting, some worried that scientists might give money mostly to their friends. Scheffer said an algorithm would prevent that, for instance by banning donations to people you have published with, but he acknowledged it would be a challenge in small research communities. SOFA might also result in a mismatch between what scientists need and what their colleagues donate, and a competition for donations could lead to a time-consuming and costly circus, comparable to an election campaign.</p>\n\n<p>The way to find out, Scheffer and Bollen say, is a real-world test, and they say the Netherlands, a small country with short lines of communication between scientists, politicians, and funding agencies, is a good place for one. Last year, Scheffer convinced Eppo Bruins, a member of the Dutch House of Representatives, to submit a motion calling for a pilot program at NWO, which the parliament approved in June 2016. The money could be taken from a &#8364;150 million NWO pot currently distributed among consortia of innovative Dutch scientists, Bruins suggested.</p>\n\n<p>But NWO is not obliged to carry out the proposal, and so far has shown little enthusiasm. &#8220;NWO is willing to explore together with scientists and other stakeholders how to improve allocation rates, but is still considering practicality and support&#8221; for SOFA, a spokesperson tells <cite>Science</cite>Insider. At last week&#8217;s meeting, NWO President Stan Gielen said the funds Bruins has in mind are distributed by NWO but are earmarked by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, which would have to give permission. Gielen added that any experiment should not come at the expense of existing funding.</p>\n\n<p>Scheffer says he&#8217;s not giving up. It&#8217;s not a risky experiment, he says: &#8220;The money would not be wasted, after all, but just be given to other scientists.&#8221; But he says he understands why NWO is not thrilled: If applied universally, the novel system would make the agency redundant. Perhaps it&#8217;s telling, Scheffer says, that he has not been invited to an <a href="http://www.nwo.nl/en/policies/nwo+conferences+2017/international+conference">international conference on applications and peer review that NWO is organizing in June</a>.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="With this new system, scientists never have to write a grant application again" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

But&#8212;as even they will tell you&#8212;they&#8217;re no match for the complexity of the human body. Heart attacks in particular are hard to anticipate. Now, scientists have shown that computers capable of teaching themselves can perform even better than standard medical guidelines, significantly increasing prediction rates. If implemented, the new method could save thousands or even millions of lives a year.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stress enough how important it is,&#8221; says Elsie Ross, a vascular surgeon at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved with the work, &#8220;and how much I really hope that doctors start to embrace the use of artificial intelligence to assist us in care of patients.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Each year, nearly 20 million people die from the effects of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks, strokes, blocked arteries, and other circulatory system malfunctions. In an effort to predict these cases, many doctors use guidelines similar to those of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA). Those are based on eight risk factors&#8212;including age, cholesterol level, and blood pressure&#8212;that physicians effectively add up.</p>\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s too simplistic to account for the many medications a patient might be on, or other disease and lifestyle factors. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of interaction in biological systems,&#8221; says Stephen Weng, an epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Some of those interactions are counterintuitive: A lot of body fat can actually protect against heart disease in some cases. &#8220;That&#8217;s the reality of the human body,&#8221; Weng says. &#8220;What computer science allows us to do is to explore those associations.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>In the new study, Weng and his colleagues compared use of the ACC/AHA guidelines with four machine-learning algorithms: random forest, logistic regression, gradient boosting, and neural networks. All four techniques analyze lots of data in order to come up with predictive tools without any human instruction. In this case, the data came from the electronic medical records of 378,256 patients in the United Kingdom. The goal was to find patterns in the records that were associated with cardiovascular events.</p>\n\n<p>First, the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms had to train themselves. They used about 78% of the data&#8212;some 295,267 records&#8212;to search for patterns and build their own internal &#8220;guidelines.&#8221; They then tested themselves on the remaining records. Using record data available in 2005, they predicted which patients would have their first cardiovascular event over the next 10 years, and checked the guesses against the 2015 records. Unlike the ACC/AHA guidelines, the machine-learning methods were allowed to take into account 22 more data points, including ethnicity, arthritis, and kidney disease.</p>\n\n<p>All four AI methods performed significantly better than the ACC/AHA guidelines. Using a statistic called AUC (in which a score of 1.0 signifies 100% accuracy), the ACC/AHA guidelines hit 0.728. The four new methods ranged from 0.745 to 0.764, Weng&#8217;s team reports this month in <cite>PLOS ONE</cite>. The best one&#8212;neural networks&#8212;correctly predicted 7.6% more events than the ACC/AHA method, and it raised 1.6% fewer false alarms. In the test sample of about 83,000 records, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0174944">that amounts to 355 additional patients whose lives could have been saved</a>. That&#8217;s because prediction often leads to prevention, Weng says, through cholesterol-lowering medication or changes in diet.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;This is high-quality work,&#8221; says Evangelos Kontopantelis, a data scientist at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom who works with primary care databases. He says that dedicating more computational power or more training data to the problem &#8220;could have led to even bigger gains.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Several of the risk factors that the machine-learning algorithms identified as the strongest predictors are not included in the ACC/AHA guidelines, such as severe mental illness and taking oral corticosteroids. Meanwhile, none of the algorithms considered diabetes, which is on the ACC/AHA list, to be among the top 10 predictors. Going forward, Weng hopes to include other lifestyle and genetic factors in computer algorithms to further improve their accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>Kontopantelis notes one limitation to the work: <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/brainlike-computers-are-black-box-scientists-are-finally-peering-inside">Machine-learning algorithms are like black boxes</a>, in that you can see the data that go&#160;in and the decision that comes out, but you can&#8217;t grasp what happens in between. That makes it difficult for humans to tweak the algorithm, and it thwarts predictions of what it will do in a new scenario.</p>\n\n<p>Will physicians soon adopt similar machine-learning methods in their practices? Doctors really pride themselves on their expertise, Ross says. &#8220;But I, being part of a newer generation, see that we can be assisted by the computer.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Self-taught artificial intelligence beats doctors at predicting heart attacks" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Researchers previously invented a method for injecting a polyacrylate mesh into brain tissue, the same water-absorbing and expanding molecule that makes dirty diapers swell up. Just add water, and the tissue enlarges to 4.5 times its original size. But it wasn&#8217;t good enough to see everything. The brain is full of diminutive protrusions called dendritic spines lining the signal receiving end of a neuron. Hundreds to thousands of these nubs help strengthen or weaken an individual dendrite&#8217;s connection to other neurons in the brain. The nanoscale size of these spines makes studying them with light microscopes impossible or blurry at best, however. Now, the same group has overcome this barrier in an improved method called iterative expansion microscopy, described today in <em>Nature Methods</em>. Here, the tissue is expanded once, the crosslinked mesh is cleaved, and then the tissue is expanded again, <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nmeth.4261">resulting in roughly 20-fold enlargement</a>. Neurons are then visualized by light-emitting molecules linked to antibodies which latch onto specified proteins. The technique has yielded detailed images showing the formation of proteins along synapses in mice, as well as detailed renderings of dendritic spines (seen in the image above) in the mouse hippocampus&#8212;a center or learning and memory in the brain. The advance could enable neuroscientists to map the many individual connections between neurons across the brain and the unique arrangement of receptors that turn brain circuits on and off.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="By blowing up brain tissue to 20 times its size, scientists see unprecedented details " class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Trees are important for timber, food, and medicine, but getting a handle on the world&#8217;s thousands of tree species is a tough task. Up until this year, there\'s been no complete census. Now, researchers have published the first global database of tree species and their geographical ranges, a &#8220;huge scientific effort,&#8221; the team reports in the <em>Journal of Sustainable Forestry</em>. The scientists compiled the searchable online&#160;<a href="https://www.bgci.org/global_tree_search.php">archive</a>, which includes over 60,000 tree species, using data from a variety of sources such as museums, botanical gardens, and agricultural institutions. They found that Brazil, Colombia, and Indonesia were the <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10549811.2017.1310049">countries with the most tree species</a>&#8212;each is home to at least 5000. And nearly 60% of the world&#8217;s trees are native to just one country, the team noted. This database, which will be continuously updated, should allow researchers, policymakers, and the public to better monitor tree diversity and efforts to conserve specific species in forests, the scientists suggest. It will also form the basis of the Global Tree Assessment, an effort to document the conservation status of each tree species before the end of the decade.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="How many tree species are there?

By carefully chipping away at the end of a chalky tube (seen in photo above), researchers found a long, black, wormlike mass oozing from its casing&#8212;the first live specimen of the giant shipworm <em>Kuphus polythalamia</em>. The animal&#8217;s length makes it the longest of any living bivalve, a class of typically small critters including clams, oysters, and scallops. And as far as shipworms go, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6276/901.full">which usually burrow into and feed on wood</a> from ships or sunken trees, <em>K. polythalamia</em> is unique for squatting down and making a home in ocean mud. A look at their digestive tracts indicates that <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1620470114">these creatures don&#8217;t eat&#8212;or poop&#8212;a whole lot</a>, the researchers report today in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Wood-munching microbes on the sea floor expel hydrogen sulfide, the molecule responsible for the distinctive smell of rotting eggs. A different set of microbes living in the gills of <em>K. polythalamia</em> uses this hydrogen sulfide as an energy source to make carbon molecules that help sustain their shipworm host. The researchers suggest that studying the shipworms&#8217; transition from eating wood to relying on sulfur might help illuminate the evolution of animals such as deep sea mussels and giant tube worms that consume hydrogen sulfide from hydrothermal vents on deep ocean sea floors.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Giant shipworms discovered hiding in sulfurous lagoons" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Every day these hunters raid termite nests to keep their colonies fed. But the ants have chosen a dangerous prey, and tussles with large soldier termites often lead to injury&#8212;limbs and antennae are sometimes lost on the battlefield. When researchers noticed that large ants called &#8220;majors&#8221; would pick up fallen soldiers and carry the live ones back to their nests, they decided to study the fate of the injured by marking them with paint. <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/4/e1602187">More than 90% of hurt ants recovered</a> to emerge from their nests and march again in future raids, the researchers report today in <cite>Science Advances</cite>. A secretion from an injured ant&#8217;s mandibles seemed to be the key to calling for help; even when perfectly healthy ants were doused in the chemical, majors came around to offer a free ride. But if no help came for an ant in need&#8212;too slow to keep up with its departing unit&#8212;that ant was almost a third more likely to get eaten by a predator or die of exhaustion on the way home. The number of ants needing rescue each day was roughly equal to the number of ants born, meaning rescues&#8212;and the distress pheromone that signals them&#8212;help colonies stay strong enough to fight another day.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Watch these ants rescue injured comrades from termite battles" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Tapping into the knowledge of previous generations&#8212;and those around us&#8212;was long thought to be a &#8220;humans-only&#8221; trait. But homing pigeons can also build collective knowledge banks, behavioral biologists have discovered, at least when it comes to finding their way back to the roost. Like humans, the birds work together and pass on information that lets them get better and better at solving problems.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It is a really exciting development in this field,&#8221; says Christine Caldwell, a psychologist at the University of Stirling in the United Kingdom who was not involved with the work.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers have <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/146/3643/549">admired pigeon intelligence</a> for decades. Previous work has shown the birds are capable of everything from <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/207/4430/543">symbolic communication</a> to <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/12/no-joke-pigeons-ace-simple-math-test">rudimentary math</a>. They also use a wide range of cues to find their way home, including <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/01/scienceshot-homing-pigeons-follow-their-noses">smell</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/10/one-eyed-pigeons-still-use-sight-find-their-way-home">sight</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/01/sound-maps-may-help-pigeons-navigate">sound</a>, and <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/205/4410/1027">magnetism</a>. On its own, a pigeon released multiple times from the same place will even modify its navigation over time for a more optimal route home. The birds also learn specific routes from one another. Because flocks of pigeons tend to take more direct flights home than individuals, scientists have long thought some sort of &#8220;collective intelligence&#8221; is at work.&#160;</p>\n\n<p>But can pigeons improve this homing ability over generations, building on the knowledge of birds that have come before? The phenomenon, known as cumulative cultural evolution, was considered &#8220;arguably unique to humans,&#8221; says Dora Biro, a behavioral biologist at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>To find out if birds share this ability, Biro and Oxford biologist Takao Sasaki strapped GPS devices on homing pigeons and divided them into three groups: birds homing by themselves, birds flying with the same partner, and birds that switched up their partner every half dozen flights or so.</p>\n\n<p>He and Biro based their design on the famous &#8220;spaghetti tower&#8221; test. In that experiment, one person was asked to build a tower as high as possible using raw spaghetti and clay while an observer looked on. Then, the builder left and the observer was asked to build a tower in front of a new observer. Researchers found that 10 &#8220;generations&#8221; of observers each built towers similar to the ones before them, but taller, demonstrating the basic idea of standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of building towers, the pigeons simply had to fly home, an instinctive behavior. Birds in all three groups improved in the first few flights home, but after that, only the group in which the most experienced bird was periodically switched out <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms15049">continued to get closer to the perfect route</a>, the researchers report today in <em>Nature Communications</em>. The new bird in the pair was the equivalent of the observer in the spaghetti tower experiment and represented the &#8220;next generation&#8221; that learned from and built upon the experienced bird&#8217;s knowledge. &#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I think the paper convincingly shows that animal groups can show both collective intelligence and cumulative culture,&#8221; says Harvard University animal behaviorist Albert Kao, who was not affiliated with the study. A na&#239;ve bird does not develop a completely new route, but instead changes an existing route that it acquires from a bird in the previous generation&#8212;and that&#8217;s a hallmark of cumulative culture, Biro adds.</p>\n\n<p>Still, not everyone is convinced. &#8220;I like the paper. It is carefully&#8212;even beautifully&#8212;done, but I think this question of whether animals can and do have cumulative culture is still open,&#8221; says Claudio Tennie, a comparative psychologist at the University of T&#252;bingen in Germany who was not involved with the work. He argues that the pigeons are not really learning a new behavior, and thus the birds demonstrate just a subtype of cumulative culture.</p>\n\n<p>Maxime Derex, an evolutionary anthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe, agrees. Cumulative culture is more complex in humans, he says. We&#8217;ve gone from the spoken to the written word and now to ever more sophisticated electronics to communicate, he notes, whereas all the birds show is that they can improve their route home.</p>\n\n<p>Biro and Sasaki accept this difference between pigeons and humans. &#8220;But our study demonstrates that nonhuman animals can accumulate knowledge and improve performance over generations, satisfying the criteria for cumulative cultural evolution,&#8221; Sasaki says. &#8220;Thus, our results suggest that [this ability] may not require sophisticated cognition as previously thought.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Think only humans can build on the knowledge of previous generations?

But hundreds of attempts helped few patients. Now, a new approach that tailors a personalized vaccine to the mutated proteins in an individual&#8217;s tumor appears to have prevented early relapses in 12 people with skin cancer. It also may have helped several others by boosting the power of a new type of cancer drug that uses a different mechanism to unleash an immune attack on the tumor.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in this very exciting, new moment&#8221; for personalized cancer vaccines, says Catherine Wu of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, whose team presented results last week at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Washington, D.C. A second team has similarly encouraging data. The two small studies, mainly designed to test safety and immune responses, are indeed &#8220;promising,&#8221; says Drew Pardoll of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. But, he cautions, it is &#8220;way too early&#8221; to draw firm conclusions about whether the vaccines will extend the lives of cancer patients.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas earlier, unsuccessful cancer vaccines usually targeted a single distinctive cancer protein shared among patients, these new ones contain multiple mutated proteins, or &#8220;neoantigens,&#8221; that are specific to an individual patient&#8217;s tumor. Giving patients a dose of their tumor neoantigens, which look foreign to the immune system, should help activate immune cells called T cells to attack the cancer cells.</p>\n\n<p>A study <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/04/personalized-cancer-vaccines-may-fight-tumors">published 2 years ago in <cite>Science</cite></a> suggested the strategy might work: It showed that a neoantigen vaccine stimulated immune responses in three advanced melanoma patients who had already received a cancer drug. But at the time researchers couldn&#8217;t say much about whether the vaccine would help curb cancer growth.</p>\n\n<p>One new study was conducted in six patients with melanoma that had spread to their lymph nodes and sometimes other sites. The patients&#8217; tumors had been removed surgically, but were likely to regrow. Wu&#8217;s team sequenced the DNA from each patient&#8217;s tumors and used computational methods to predict mutations that coded for neoantigens. Then they made each patient a personal vaccine containing about 20 of these neoantigens. The researchers injected the vaccine under the patients&#8217; skin periodically for 5 months. They had no serious side effects and showed &#8220;strong, potent T cell responses&#8221; specific to many of their vaccine neoantigens, says Wu, whose collaborator Nir Hacohen of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reported the results at the AACR meeting. All are now cancer-free up to 32 months later.</p>\n\n<p>The two patients with the most advanced disease did relapse, but Wu&#8217;s team deployed an additional weapon: an immunotherapy drug called a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor. These antibody drugs <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/05/cancer-immunotherapy-takes-aim-mutation-riddled-tumors">block receptors on T cells that tumors use to hide from the immune system</a>. On their own, the drugs have vanquished tumors in people with certain cancers who otherwise had no hope. In metastatic melanoma they help up to 40% of patients, but in only 5% do tumors disappear completely. When the two relapsed patients in Wu&#8217;s study received a PD-1 inhibitor, their new tumors vanished.</p>\n\n<p>Similar results come from an international trial using a vaccine developed by Ugur Sahin of University Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany. The team injected RNA coding for up to 10 tumor neoantigens into the lymph nodes of 13 advanced melanoma patients whose tumors had been removed. Eleven remain cancer-free up to 26 months later, including two whose tumors reappeared, then shrank or were surgically removed, Sahin says. Another patient whose cancer returned received a PD-1 inhibitor and is also tumor-free.</p>\n\n<p>Sahin&#8217;s and Wu&#8217;s results have been submitted for publication. Two of three patients from the first clinical test published 2 years ago are also in remission more than 2.5 years later, one after relapsing and then receiving a PD-1 inhibitor, says trial leader Gerald Linette of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>\n\n<p>Pardoll and others caution, however, that it&#8217;s not possible to know whether neoantigen vaccines perform better than a PD-1 inhibitor alone without doing larger studies. Other questions remain about how best to design and deliver neoantigen vaccines. Right now the vaccines are costly and take months to make, which may be too long for some patients with metastatic disease.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, several biotech companies are launching trials combining neoantigen vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors for various cancers, including Neon Therapeutics in Cambridge, which Wu and Hacohen co-founded.</p>\n\n<p>The Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy in San Francisco, California, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/qa-what-can-250-million-achieve-chief-new-cancer-immunotherapy-institute-explains">launched a year ago</a> by Napster co-founder and biotech billionaire Sean Parker, is trying to figure out how to tailor the best possible vaccines through a competition. Thirty companies and academic groups will receive the same set of tumor samples from individual patients and will try to predict the best neoantigens. The Parker Institute and another sponsor will test them with lab assays, then feed back the results so participants can improve their algorithms. Says Parker Institute Vice President for Research Fred Ramsdell: &#8220;At the end, we&#8217;ll have a good idea of how to correctly pick neoantigens for a vaccine.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Personalized tumor vaccines keep cancer in check" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

In a lecture hall buzzing with excitement, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and the Spanish government yesterday presented a plan to open a new lab here for the study of tissues and organs. The center, EMBL\'s first new outpost in 18 years, will host six to eight research groups; a director has yet to be named but recruitment has begun.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement is welcome news to the Spanish scientific community, which has suffered from years of budget cuts and political neglect. The agreement also strengthens Barcelona\'s profile as one of southern Europe\'s premier science hubs, adds Joan Guinovart, director of the Institute for Research in Biomedicine here. &#8220;Barcelona is already one of the hottest spots in biomedicine in Europe," he says.</p>\n\n<p>Headquartered in Heidelberg, Germany, EMBL is an international organization supported by 22 member states; it\'s not affiliated with the European Union. Over the decades, EMBL has established specialized franchises for structural biology in Hamburg, Germany, and Grenoble, France; for bioinformatics in Hinxton, U.K.; and finally, in 1999, for mouse biology in Monterotondo, Italy. The new branch, housed at the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park (PRBB), will study how cells organize and interact at the tissue level. &#8220;For a long time, tissue was not possible to study with molecular biology; now it is becoming possible, thanks to the development of new imaging techniques,&#8221; Jan Ellenberg, the head of EMBL\'s Cell Biology &amp; Biophysics Unit, said during yesterday\'s ceremony.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p class="Science">In 2006, EMBL established a joint research unit at PRBB with Barcelona\'s Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), led by current CRG director and former EMBL department head Luis Serrano. The partnership combined computational biology with genomics and proteomics to tackle complex systems biology problems. &#8220;The quality of the work that was done here was outstanding,&#8221; EMBL Director-General Iain Mattaj tells <em>Science</em>Insider. That helped convince EMBL\'s other member states to establish a fully fledged lab here, he says, as did the presence of strong universities, research institutes, and a hospital.</p>\n\n<p class="Science">EMBL will invest &#8364;16 million in the new site during the first 5 years. Spain, which contributes about &#8364;9 million annually to EMBL&#8212;8.5% of the organization\'s total budget&#8212;has put an additional &#8364;6 million on the table until 2021. The Catalan government will foot the &#8364;400,000 annual bill for rent and maintenance.</p>\n\n<p class="Science">EMBL Barcelona will provide access to state-of-the art technologies for imaging and modelling of tissues and organs, including a facility to grow organoids, mini-versions of real organs produced in vitro. Researchers will also use computers to model diseases in organs and tissues. &#8220;This opens great opportunities scientifically,&#8221; says Serrano; &#8220;for CRG, it&#8217;s a nice way to grow critical mass&#8221; in the field, he adds. &#8220;One of the biggest frontiers in biology is trying to understand organ functioning, [both] from an intellectual and medical point of view.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="EMBL opens new lab for tissue biology and disease modeling in Barcelona" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Soon after that text, Weinberg and two other march enthusiasts she met online found themselves leading a global movement that has attracted millions of followers, with goals that include dramatizing concerns that political leaders are ignoring scientific evidence and demonstrating broad support for science. To turn that vision into reality, the trio has recruited scores of volunteer coordinators, negotiated partnerships with dozens of science groups, and raised some $1 million to pay for everything from security to portable toilets.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Every step of the way has been completely terrifying,&#8221; Weinberg says. &#8220;&#8216;Seems like it would be pretty easy&#8217; will be on my tombstone,&#8221; she jokes.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>March organizers admit they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;ll find at the end of their exhausting sprint. They are uncertain of how many marchers will appear, and how the demonstrations will be received. But they also are already looking past 22 April. They see march day as a beginning, not an end, as March for Science tries to pivot from being an event organizer to becoming a lasting force for science advocacy.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building an organization that is going to last beyond the march,&#8221; says Jonathan Berman, a march co-chair and a postdoctoral fellow studying hypertension at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. The goal, he says, is to create a group that can help science advocates develop the organizing and lobbying skills they need &#8220;to make their concerns heard&#8221; and &#8220;have an effect on politics.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>March organizers kept that long-term goal in mind as they shaped the Washington, D.C., event. They chose speakers who they believed would highlight the value of a vibrant and diverse scientific community. Lydia Villa-Komaroff, a Mexican-American biologist who helped demonstrate how bacteria could make insulin, will speak to the role of basic research in producing valuable discoveries. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician who helped expose dangerous lead levels in Flint, Michigan&#8217;s drinking water, symbolizes the value of science-informed advocacy. TV personality Bill Nye has become an icon of creative efforts to get young people excited about science. March planners also arranged teach-ins, including one on the science of superheroes, with the goal of getting march attendees excited about reaching out to their own communities upon returning home. And 22 April will kick off a &#8220;week of science action,&#8221; during which organizers will encourage marchers everywhere to maintain the momentum through small actions, such as posting social media messages on specific themes.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the organizers steered clear of politicians, desiring a nonpartisan atmosphere. The goal was to create &#8220;as big of a tent&#8221; as possible, says anthropologist Valorie Aquino, the third march co-chair and a Ph.D. student at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.</p>\n\n<p>March organizers are hoping for a large turnout on 22 April, but&#8212;like any good scientist&#8212;they say further evaluation will be necessary before they can draw conclusions about the event&#8217;s success. Increased advocacy from the scientific community and more science-based evidence in policy decisions could take years to come about, they concede.</p>\n\n<p>But they aren&#8217;t waiting long to take their next step. The day after the march, organizers plan to meet in Washington, D.C., with partners to discuss how March for Science can continue. Those discussions are likely to revisit many of the logistical challenges and politically sensitive issues that the group confronted over the past few months.</p>\n\n<p>Raising money, for instance, will remain a key challenge. Weinberg has dipped into her savings in order to work on the march full time. Aquino, who suspended her research to focus on the event, has been supporting herself by working as an online teaching assistant. Both would like to continue their science advocacy work through the March for Science organization. Weinberg hopes there will be just enough money leftover from march fundraising to help jump-start the group&#8217;s next steps. But funds have mostly come from individual donations and merchandise sales, which she fears will drop off after the march. (Fundraising has been complicated, she says, by vendors selling knockoff March for Science swag while falsely claiming to send proceeds to the organization.)</p>\n\n<p>The group will also have to decide how it will advocate for science without becoming too entangled in partisan politics. March critics have already noted that politically conservative scientists might not feel welcome in a group that tends to lean liberal. And others have hotly debated how the march has handled diversity issues. The organizers say that, more than aiming to advocate for a single issue, candidate, or party, they want to catalyze a cultural shift, erasing what they say many scientists see as an uncrossable line between science and advocacy. &#8220;I want scientists to get out of their comfort zone a little bit, to not leave data at someone\'s doorstep and walk away,&#8221; Aquino says.</p>\n\n<p>March organizers know they&#8217;re not the first to urge scientists to speak out&#8212;march partners AAAS (publisher of <cite>Science</cite>Insider), the Union of Concerned Scientists, and other groups have long pursued similar goals. But they note the march has roused hundreds of thousands of grassroots advocates, including nonscientists, and say that failing to follow up with them would be a lost opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;If this whole thing ended after April 22,&#8221; says Weinberg, &#8220;I would consider the last two-and-a-half months of my life kind of wasted.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="On eve of science march, planners look ahead" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Now, for the first time, scientists have untangled why shoelace knots fail. The work also reveals the best knots to tie and could have implications for everything from surgery to new cancer drugs.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We deal with them coming untied all the time,&#8221; says Colin Adams, a mathematician at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, who was not involved with the study. &#8220;And yet, nobody&#8217;s ever taken the time to say: Why does it happen?&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s one thing we do know about shoelaces: The &#8220;square knot&#8221; holds up better than the &#8220;granny knot.&#8221; Both knots appear about the same, with two bunny-ear loops, but the granny tends to rotate to its side&#8212;one loop pointing up the shoe, the other down. (Still confused? Check out this&#160;<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/terry_moore_how_to_tie_your_shoes">TED video</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>To find out why even the best knots fail, Oliver O&#8217;Reilly, a mechanical engineer at the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues put a volunteer on a treadmill. The test subject tied her shoes with the weaker granny knot so that the researchers had a better chance of watching it unravel. The scientists attached accelerometers to her shoes to measure the acceleration, or g-force, the knot experienced with each stride.</p>\n\n<p>Using slow-motion video, the team uncovered two stages of knot&#160;slippage: a gradual loosening with each step, and a sudden &#8220;catastrophic failure.&#8221; When the knot started to unravel, it fell apart within two strides. The researchers were surprised by the g-force the knot experienced as it bobbed up and down, which was more than any rollercoaster can generate.</p>\n  \n  <div class="entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-image">\n  \n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/shoelace_s_v_w.jpg?itok=HUfxFz3O" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/shoelace_s_v_w.jpg?itok=HUfxFz3O 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/shoelace_s_v_w.jpg?itok=9NrzMiXs 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption">\n  \n      <p>The team at the University of California,&#160;Berkeley, tested two types of knots to see which stayed tied longer.</p>\n  \n</div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      Christopher Daily-Diamond  \n</div>\n    </figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n  \n  \n      <p>Walking was key. The same knot that failed within 15 meters of walking stuck around if participants just stomped their feet on the ground or swung them while sitting on a table, the team reports today in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society</em>. <a href="http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rspa.2016.0770">Neither impact by itself&#8212;stomping or swinging&#8212;was enough to undo the knots</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We were able to see that these two combined effects lead to shoe knots failing,&#8221; O&#8217;Reilly says. &#8220;You need both together.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The scientists then designed an experiment to measure how long it took for knots to unravel and the rate at which the laces slipped. Working on a shoestring budget and borrowing lab equipment on weekends, the researchers designed a mechanical pendulum that smacked a plate. The pendulum&#8217;s swing approximated leg movements, and the smack the impact of shoes with the ground. The pendulum sported a shoelace with weighted ends&#8212;the added weight was needed to simulate how strongly the ends whip on runners&#8217; shoes. The team used this controlled setup to calculate the precise slip rate of shoelaces, tied either granny or square.</p>\n\n<p>The experiment confirmed the treadmill observations. Both knots initially slipped apart at a slow, gradual rate with each swing and smack of the pendulum. Eventually, though, the laces became loose enough to rapidly slip apart at a much faster rate. The study also demonstrated the superiority of the square knot. This winning knot failed about half the time (when weighted), whereas the granny knot always failed.</p>\n\n<p>But though the scientists know that one knot is more resilient, they still can&#8217;t explain why. It may have something to do with how the laces press against each other within the knot and the knot&#8217;s tension, Adams says. &#8220;If you could actually predict when a knot is going to fail,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that would have implications beyond shoelaces.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>This could include knots used in surgical sutures, on boats, and in mountaineering. But knots also exist on the microscopic level: DNA knots and unknots when it creates copies of itself, for example. Scientists are already exploiting these properties to create drugs that slow tumor growth.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Why do shoelaces untie themselves?

And on 22 April she will be leading a team of 16 faculty members and students from the University of Maryland in College Park who will commute to downtown Washington, D.C., to gather data from the crowd assembled on the National Mall for the flagship U.S. march. Fisher hopes that more than 500 people will complete a two-page survey asking what brought them to the event, their level of political activism, and the nature of their work.</p>\n\n<p>A different team, led by political sociologist Michael Heaney of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, also wants to explore the political identities of the marchers. Their approach will require a six-page survey, and Heaney says he&#8217;ll be ecstatic if 250 people wade through it.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>A third group wants to explore scientific norms, that is, what marchers think is appropriate political behavior by scientists. The four-person team, led by political scientist Michael Xenos of the University of Wisconsin in Madison and deployed by graduate student April Eichmeier, hopes to engage some 200 participants.</p>\n\n<p><cite>Science</cite>Insider has also identified a fourth group of researchers who hope to study the march without actually being there in person. The team, from nearby George Mason University (GMU) in Fairfax, Virginia, are asking organizers to help them recruit participants for a survey by sending out a note to the march\'s email list and social media followers.</p>\n\n<h2>Unprecedented opportunity</h2>\n\n<p>Scientists are no strangers to political activism. But the potential magnitude of this month&#8217;s marches&#8212;scheduled for hundreds of cities across the United States and around the world&#8212;may be unprecedented, says Scott Frickel, who studies mass mobilizations at Brown University and is part of Fisher&#8217;s group.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge for researchers is to understand what is driving people to act now and what their actions say about the status of science in today&#8217;s fractious political culture. &#8220;People are always upset about something,&#8221; Frickel says. &#8220;But they start movements when they see the possibility of losing what they have.&#8221; Fisher is predicting as many as 100,000 will show up at the Washington, D.C., march alone, if the weather cooperates.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers hope the data they collect will also give them a sense of what might happen next. &#8220;It&#8217;s the nature of mass mobilization,&#8221; Frickel says. &#8220;You get people in the streets, and then you figure out what you want to do.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Fisher has been doing surveys of large-scale climate protests for more than a decade. Though she specializes in environmental issues&#8212;the March for Science takes place on Earth Day&#8212;she also surveyed participants in this year&#8217;s postinaugural Women&#8217;s March on Washington.</p>\n\n<p>Her M4S instrument is based on the two-page questionnaire she used for that march. But it will contain seven additional questions&#8212;including one asking for the participant&#8217;s job title and another that requests a description of what they do at work&#8212;that are aimed at capturing the unusual demographics expected for the M4S. Although the survey is anonymous, it asks those willing to participate in a follow-up interview weeks or months later to provide contact information.</p>\n\n<p>What happens after 22 April is a less compelling question for Heaney, who studies how social movements and political party affiliation shape public policy. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure what I would make of the [follow-up] data if I asked,&#8221; he says. For Heaney, M4S offers a chance to use the science march to enrich his previous findings, such as studies showing that people tend &#8220;to abandon a movement rather than [to switch] parties.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>For example, his M4S survey asks participants to select from a list of 28 causes that might have prompted them to hit the streets at some point in their lives, from opposing the 1960s Vietnam War to Black Lives Matter and &#8220;stop Obama health care.&#8221; Fisher&#8217;s similar list of 11 topics is much shorter and asks participants to go back only a decade. It&#8217;s also more generic&#8212;the categories include peace and racial justice, for example&#8212;when dealing with the topic that prompted them to protest.</p>\n\n<p>Like his colleagues, Xenos wants to find out why people are attending the march, how they learned about it, and a bit about who they are. But he&#8217;s also interested in what they hope to accomplish, and what they think of scientists who adopt this form of political expression.</p>\n\n<h2>March madness methodologies</h2>\n\n<p>At the march, the survey takers will face the challenge of selecting participants from among the throng. All of the researchers are planning to use a variation of the standard technique for randomizing the process. Fisher&#8217;s team will plunge into the crowd and grab every fifth person, for example, whereas Heaney&#8217;s crew will start by spotting an &#8220;anchor&#8221;&#8212;a person who catches their eye for whatever reason&#8212;and then pick those who are five persons to the right and left of that individual.</p>\n\n<p>Once they find a willing subject, however, their methodology will vary. Fisher&#8217;s team will be armed with computer tablets, which they will hand over to marchers and then gently monitor their progress. It is way more efficient than using paper questionnaires, which later must be typed into computers, she says.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, Heaney will use the traditional clipboards, and Eichmeier&#8217;s crew will record the interviews, which they will later transcribe. Under survey rules approved by their university&#8217;s Institutional Review Board, the research teams won&#8217;t have to get written prior consent from their subjects because the subjects will not be identified in any way. And only those 18 and older will be asked to participate.</p>\n\n<p>Away from the march, the GMU team is taking a digital approach. Rather than in-person interviews, they are asking march organizers to help them query thousands of people who have expressed their support for the march via email&#160;or on social media. (The March for Science would not share its email or social media lists with the researchers; rather, it would let followers know the researchers are seeking their responses on a survey.)</p>\n\n<p>The GMU researchers realize that many of those people will not be scientists themselves.&#160;&#8220;The march is a unique opportunity to measure public perceptions of public engagement by scientists and the role of science in society,&#8221; says Teresa Ann Myers, a researcher at GMU&#8217;s climate change communications center that has proposed the study. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of talk about that online, but there isn&#8217;t much in the literature.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Jonathan Berman, an M4S co-chair, says the steering committee is reviewing requests from several researchers interested in contacting their supporters. &#8220;We\'re looking forward to working with social scientists who do know how to ask the right scientific questions to generate scholarly output about the march,&#8221; says Berman, a postdoc at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. Berman says that it&#8217;s unlikely any decisions will be made until after the march, however, a timeframe that Myers says &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t be a problem.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>High refusal rates are the bane of every survey researcher, and the willingness of participants to engage can vary greatly. Those attending this winter&#8217;s Women&#8217;s March on Washington were very receptive, says Fisher, with only 7.5% declining. That&#8217;s the lowest refusal rate ever for her, but she won&#8217;t be surprised if the M4S erases that record. After all, who better understands the value of doing research than a fellow researcher?</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Clarification, 4/13/2017, 11:21 a.m.:</strong> The story has been revised to clarify that the GMU researchers are not asking March for Science to share its email or social media lists with the researchers, but asking march organizers to distribute notice of a survey instrument on their behalf.</em></p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Examine thyself: Researchers set to study the March for Science" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Somewhere along the line, the ancestor of dinosaurs diverged from the ancestor of crocodiles, a momentous split in the evolution of vertebrates that ultimately set the stage for the age of dinos. But the details of that split remain mysterious, thanks to a dearth of fossils of early dinosaur relatives. Enter the newly identified 247-million- to 242-million-year-old <em>Teleocrater rhadinus</em>, a close relative of dinosaurs that also happened to walk on all fours and share some key features with the ancestors of crocodiles. These shared features, the authors say, suggest that it&#8217;s time to rethink what we thought we knew about dinosaurs&#8217; earliest ancestors.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been waiting a long time to find fossils like this that fit in this part of the family tree,&#8221; says Randall Irmis, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum of Utah in Salt Lake City, who was not involved in the work. &#8220;This has pretty big implications for how we understand the early evolution of dinosaurs.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Some 251 million years ago, at the end of the Permian period, a mass extinction wiped out most of life on Earth. In its wake arose a group of egg-laying reptile precursors called archosaurs, the common ancestors of dinosaurs, flying reptiles known as pterosaurs, and crocodiles. At some point during the next period, the Triassic, pterosaurs and dinosaurs split off from the crocodile lineage.</p>\n\n<p>Those two different lineages, avian versus crocodilian, have long been identified by their types of ankle joints. Dinosaurs and pterosaurs all have a version of a hinged, birdlike ankle, rather than the crocodilelike ankle with ball-and-socket joint.</p>\n\n<p>But exactly what early dinosaurs and their closest relatives looked like has been something of a mystery, because few fossils exist from the dawn of the dinosaurs. And many of the fossils that do exist, collected perhaps decades to a century ago, languish unidentified in museum drawers.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, <em>Teleocrater</em> isn&#8217;t a completely new discovery. A specimen was first unearthed in what is now Tanzania in the 1930s and sat in London&#8217;s Natural History Museum until 1956, when Ph.D. candidate Alan Charig (later a paleontologist at the museum) dubbed it <em>T. rhadinus</em> (referring to the shape of the animal&#8217;s hip and its slender body). Charig, who died in 1997 but is included as an author on the new paper, speculated that it was some sort of early dinosaur relative. But the fossil was in pieces, just bits of vertebrae and pelvis and limb, and difficult to place on the family tree.</p>\n\n<p>Then in 2015, Sterling Nesbitt, a paleontologist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University&#160;in Blacksburg, and a team of researchers headed back to southern Tanzania to take another look at the middle Triassic rocks where <em>Teleocrater</em> was first discovered. This time, the rocks&#8212;estimated to be about 247 million to 242 million years old&#8212;yielded several individuals of the same species. With that new bounty, the researchers were able to catalog many more of the creature&#8217;s features&#8212;enough to place it on the vertebrate family tree.</p>\n\n<p><em>Teleocrater</em>, Nesbitt and his co-authors report online today in <cite>Nature</cite>, <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature22037">belongs at the very base of the avian lineage that later gave rise to dinosaurs</a>. It has a characteristic muscle scar on the upper leg bone that is found only in the avian lineage of birds and dinosaurs and is missing in crocodiles and their relatives. But <em>Teleocrater</em> also had a crocodilelike ankle, with a ball-and-socket joint. That suggests that the crocodile ankle came first, and the bird ankle evolved later.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s key, because the ankle joint has been used for decades as an indicator of avian versus&#160;crocodilian lineage, so <em>Teleocrater</em> must be close to the split between them. And in several respects, Nesbitt says, &#8220;<em>Teleocrater</em> looks more like the relatives of the crocodiles than the relatives of dinosaurs.&#8221; The carnivorous animal, which was roughly the size of a small lion, walked on all fours, its forelimbs and hindlimbs are similar in proportion, and the limbs themselves are pretty short relative to the length of the body.</p>\n\n<p>Seemingly small details like these can produce ripples throughout paleontology collections, because they can help researchers properly classify fossils that had seemed to be walking contradictions. &#8220;These fossils exist in museums around the world, but until you find a keystone&#8212;something that helps you understand the full anatomy [of a species]&#8212;you won&#8217;t understand where these animals go on the tree of life,&#8221; Nesbitt says.</p>\n\n<p>After identifying <em>Teleocrater</em> as an ancestor along the avian lineage, the authors could group it with several other difficult-to-place animals, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongusuchus"><em>Dongusuchus</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spondylosoma"><em>Spondylosoma</em></a>, naming a new group of long-necked, carnivorous quadrupeds dubbed Aphanosauria (hidden or obscure lizards, in Greek). Aphanosaurs, they suggest, are the earliest group in the avian stem lineage to diverge from the crocodile lineage. And that suggests that these bird and dinosaur ancestors were far more diverse and widely distributed across the globe during the middle Triassic than once thought.</p>\n\n<p>The find may also alter what paleontologists hunt for in the field, as well as how they understand existing collections, says Max Langer, a paleontologist at the University of S<span>&#227;</span>o Paulo in Rio Claro, Brazil. &#8220;Now that we know the diagnostic features of this group of archosaurs, everybody working on middle Triassic rocks will be looking for something similar.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Curious fossil could rewrite early days of the dinosaurs" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

The question has been as difficult to answer as it has been controversial. Now, the largest brain-imaging study of its kind indeed finds some sex-specific patterns, but overall more similarities than differences. The work raises new questions about how brain differences between the sexes may influence intelligence and behavior.</p>\n\n<p>For decades, brain scientists have noticed that on average, male brains tend to have slightly higher total brain volume than female ones, even when corrected for males&#8217; larger average body size. But it has proved&#160;notoriously tricky to pin down exactly which substructures within the brain are more or less voluminous. Most studies have looked at relatively small sample sizes&#8212;typically fewer than 100 brains&#8212;making large-scale conclusions impossible.</p>\n\n<p>In the new study, a team of researchers led by psychologist Stuart Ritchie, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Edinburgh, turned to data from <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/uk-begins-worlds-largest-biomedical-imaging-study">UK Biobank</a>, an ongoing, long-term biomedical study of people living in the United Kingdom with 500,000 enrollees. A subset of those enrolled in the study underwent brain scans using MRI. In 2750 women and 2466 men aged 44&#8211;77, Ritchie and his colleagues examined the volumes of 68 regions within the brain, as well as the thickness of the cerebral cortex, the brain&#8217;s wrinkly outer layer thought to be important in consciousness, language, memory, perception, and other functions.</p>\n\n<p>Adjusting for age, on average, they found that women tended to have significantly thicker cortices than men. Thicker cortices have been associated with higher scores on a variety of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678742/">cognitive</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3985090/">general intelligence</a> tests. Meanwhile, men&#160;had higher brain volumes than women&#160;in every subcortical region they looked at, including the hippocampus (which plays broad roles in memory and spatial awareness), the amygdala (emotions, memory, and decision-making), striatum (learning, inhibition, and reward-processing), and thalamus (processing and relaying sensory information to other parts of the brain).</p>\n\n<p>When the researchers adjusted the numbers to look at the subcortical regions relative to overall brain size, the comparisons became much closer: There were only 14 regions where men had higher brain volume and 10 regions where women did.</p>\n\n<p>Volumes and cortical thickness between <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/04/123729">men&#160;also tended to vary much more than they did between women</a>, the researchers report this month in a paper posted to the bioRxiv server, which makes articles available before they have been peer reviewed.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s intriguing because it lines up with previous work looking at <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00096.x">sex and IQ tests</a>. &#8220;[That previous study] finds no average difference in intelligence, but males were more variable than females,&#8221; Ritchie says. &#8220;This is why our finding that male participants&#8217; brains were, in most measures, more variable than female participants&#8217; brains is so interesting. It fits with a lot of other evidence that seems to point toward males being more variable physically and mentally.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Despite the study&#8217;s consistent sex-linked patterns, the researchers also found considerable overlap between men and women in brain volume and cortical thickness, just as you might find in height.&#160;In other words, just by looking at the brain scan, or height, of someone plucked at random from the study, researchers would be hard pressed to say whether it came from a man or woman. That suggests both sexes&#8217; brains are far more similar than they are different.</p>\n\n<p>The study didn&#8217;t account for whether participants&#8217; gender matched their biological designation as male or female.</p>\n\n<p>The study&#8217;s sheer size makes the results convincing, writes Amber Ruigrok, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom who has studied sex differences in the brain, in an email to <cite>Science</cite>. &#8220;Larger overall volumes in males and higher cortical thickness in females fits with findings from previous research. But since previous research mostly used relatively small sample sizes, this study confirms these predictions.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Ruigrok notes one factor that should be addressed in future studies: menopause. Many of the women in the study were in the age range of the stages of menopause, and hormonal fluctuations have been shown to influence brain structures. That may have played some role in the sex differences noted in the study, she says.</p>\n\n<p>The controversial&#8212;and still unsettled&#8212;question is whether these patterns mean anything to intelligence or behavior. Though popular culture is replete with supposed examples of intellectual and behavioral differences between the sexes, only a few, like higher physical aggression in men, have been borne out by scientific research.</p>\n\n<p>For the moment, Ritchie says his work isn&#8217;t equipped to answer such heady questions: He is focused on accurately describing the differences in the male and female brain, not speculating on what they could mean.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Study finds some significant differences in brains of men and women" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

But as the mudflats are filled in and developed&#8212;because of&#160;dams, rising sea levels, and the construction of sea walls&#8212;the <a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2017/170413/ncomms14895/full/ncomms14895.html">birds most dependent on this stopover are declining, in some cases by as much as 8% per year</a>, researchers report today in <cite>Nature Communications</cite>. Biologists analyzed data collected by citizen scientists between 1993 and 2012 about the numbers of 10 bird species that reach New Zealand and Australia. The numbers in species such as the gray-tailed tattler that don&#8217;t rely heavily on the mudflats remained about stable over that time, they discovered. But for the seven species of&#160;which at least 60% need to make this pit stop, numbers declined. Those species in trouble include the eastern curlew (see photo), the curlew sandpiper, and the great knot. In contrast, the analysis found that total migration distance, body size, nonbreeding grounds location, and other factors have not contributed to this decline. Given the critical importance of these stopovers, the researchers call for greater international efforts to slow the mudflat loss. Already, 36 governments and other organizations have formed the <a href="http://www.eaaflyway.net/http:/www.eaaflyway.net/">East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership</a>, but they may not be able to act in time to save these birds, the researchers note.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Migrating shorebirds in danger, due to disappearing mudflats" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Adults from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean swim to the Sargasso Sea to reproduce, and their offspring take a few years to return the 6000 kilometers to their respective coastlines. How they get there has been an enduring mystery. Many biologists have assumed these newborns drift aimlessly until swept up into the Gulf Stream, but like a few other marine creatures, they may actually use Earth&#8217;s magnetic field to guide their course, marine biologists have now discovered.</p>\n\n<p>Some researchers question whether this sixth sense exists in the very youngest eels found in the Sargasso Sea, but if it does, &#8220;this study adds to the growing body of evidence that the magnetic sense may be an important component of fishes that make long migrations in the ocean,&#8221; says Michael Miller, an eel biologist at Nihon University in Fujisawa, Japan, who was not involved in the work. And if it holds up that newborn eels do more than drift aimlessly, the study&#160;paints a new picture: These&#160;young eels&#160;&#8220;may be the ultimate swimming machines,&#8221; he adds.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, researchers have found that a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/06/maverick-scientist-thinks-he-has-discovered-magnetic-sixth-sense-humans">magnetic sixth sense</a> exists, perhaps even in people, and is important in <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/02/scienceshot-chinook-salmon-navigate-gpshttp:/www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/02/scienceshot-chinook-salmon-navigate-gps">salmon</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2004/04/magnetic-maps-guide-migrating-turtles">sea turtle</a>, and <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/07/big-magnet-small-fish">trout</a> migrations. And some work indicates that adult eels also sense magnetic fields. But proving the same was true of juvenile eels was quite tricky, as these fish can be quite erratic in their behavior. That makes it hard to discern any patterns in their orientation, and thus they are difficult to test.</p>\n\n<p>To better quantify whether eels did tend to swim in a particular direction in response to a magnetic field, Lewis Naisbett-Jones, a marine biologist at University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, and Nathan Putman, a marine biologist from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory at the University of Miami in Florida, designed a 25-centimeter-wide underwater arena: a central chamber connected to a dozen outer sections, each representing 30&#176; on a compass. They tested so-called glass eels, which is what the juvenile eels transform into when they arrive in Europe. A movable wall kept the eel in the center until the magnetic field was turned on and testing began.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers simulated magnetic fields from different parts of the migration route, and the fish responded as if they knew where they were going. <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)30284-1">In the magnetic field that was the same as in the Sargasso Sea, most of the eels headed southwest</a>, showing they did head in a particular direction in response to the magnetic field. In the test using the magnetic field found in the Atlantic off North America, the eels turned northeast, showing that slightly different magnetic fields caused them to orient in a different way, the researchers report today in <cite>Current Biology</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;We were not surprised to find eels have a magnetic map, but we were surprised to discover how well they can detect subtle differences in magnetic fields&#8221; Naisbett-Jones says.</p>\n\n<p>At first, the orientations were confusing&#8212;the eels weren\'t headed the most direct way home. Yet a computer model showed that the headings taken by the juvenile eels in the experiment would in fact make their migration more efficient, as they got the fish into the Gulf Stream faster and kept them in this current so that they headed to Europe.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Swimming the \'wrong\' direction for a bit gets them into the Antilles Current, which connects them to the Gulf Stream,&#8221; Putman explains. &#8220;So, with a little bit of work they can get a mostly free ride to Europe.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The oceanographic model "strengthens the overall findings,&#8221; says Miguel Baltazar-Soares, a marine biologist at Bournemouth University in Poole, U.K., who was not involved with the work.</p>\n\n<p>However, the study has a major flaw, several experts say. Eels undergo several major transformations. Newborns are not very eellike at all, being more like flattened gelatinous ribbons than rounded elongated fish, so it&#8217;s not clear that these newborns would have the same sensory capabilities of the juveniles tested, says Caroline Durif, a marine biologist at the Institute of Marine Research in Bergen, Norway. &#8220;I would also like to point out that none of the authors are recognized eel experts&#8212;the paper&#8217;s main authors have not focused on eels before in their research. Otherwise, they would have realized how absurd this study is.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>But Putman doesn&#8217;t think the use of older eels is a problem and assumes even newborns have this magnetic sense. Instead, he thinks that the novelty of finding a magnetic compass in eels &#8220;might rub some people the wrong way&#8221; because they had not discovered it before.</p>\n\n<p>Next, he hopes to demonstrate that adult eels also use magnetism to find their way to the Sargasso Sea.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Young European eels may use magnetic fields to guide them home" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Hiring by algorithm would give men and women an equal chance at work, the thinking goes, and predicting criminal behavior with big data would sidestep racial prejudice in policing. But a new study shows that computers can be biased as well, especially when they learn from us. When algorithms glean the meaning of words by gobbling up lots of human-written text, they adopt stereotypes very similar to our own.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think that AI is some fairy godmother,&#8221; says study co-author Joanna Bryson, a computer scientist at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom and Princeton University. &#8220;AI is just an extension of our existing culture.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The work was inspired by a psychological tool called the implicit association test, or IAT. In the IAT, words flash on a computer screen, and the speed at which people react to them indicates subconscious associations. Both black and white Americans, for example, are faster at associating names like &#8220;Brad&#8221; and &#8220;Courtney&#8221; with words like &#8220;happy&#8221; and &#8220;sunrise,&#8221; and names like &#8220;Leroy&#8221; and &#8220;Latisha&#8221; with words like &#8220;hatred&#8221; and &#8220;vomit&#8221; than vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>To test for similar bias in the &#8220;minds&#8221; of machines, Bryson and colleagues developed a word-embedding association test (WEAT). They started with an established set of &#8220;word embeddings,&#8221; basically a computer&#8217;s definition of a word, based on the contexts in which the word usually appears. So &#8220;ice&#8221; and &#8220;steam&#8221; have similar embeddings, because both often appear within a few words of &#8220;water&#8221; and rarely with, say, &#8220;fashion.&#8221; But to a computer an embedding is represented as a string of numbers, not a definition that humans can intuitively understand. Researchers at Stanford University generated the embeddings used in the current paper <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1162">by analyzing hundreds of billions of words on the internet</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of measuring human reaction time, the WEAT computes the similarity between those strings of numbers. Using it, Bryson&#8217;s team found that the embeddings for names like &#8220;Brett&#8221; and &#8220;Allison&#8221; were more similar to those for positive words including love and laughter, and those for names like &#8220;Alonzo&#8221; and &#8220;Shaniqua&#8221; were more similar to negative words like &#8220;cancer&#8221; and &#8220;failure.&#8221; To the computer, bias was baked into the words.</p>\n\n<p>IATs have also shown that, on average, Americans associate men with work, math, and science, and women with family and the arts. And young people are generally considered more pleasant than old people. All of these associations were found with the WEAT. The program also inferred that flowers were more pleasant than insects and musical instruments were more pleasant than weapons, using the same technique to measure the similarity of their embeddings to those of positive and negative words.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers then developed a word-embedding factual association test, or WEFAT. The test determines how strongly words are associated with other words, and then compares the strength of those associations to facts in the real world. For example, it looked at how closely related the embeddings for words like &#8220;hygienist&#8221; and &#8220;librarian&#8221; were to those of words like &#8220;female&#8221; and &#8220;woman.&#8221; For each profession, it then compared this computer-generated gender association measure to the actual percentage of women in that occupation. The results were very highly correlated. So embeddings can encode everything from common sentiments about flowers to racial and gender biases and <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/183">even facts about the labor force</a>, the team reports today in <cite>Science</cite>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of cool that these algorithms discovered these,&#8221; says Tolga Bolukbasi, a computer scientist at Boston University who concurrently conducted <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6228-man-is-to-computer-programmer-as-woman-is-to-homemaker-debiasing-word-embeddings">similar work with similar results</a>. &#8220;When you&#8217;re training these word embeddings, you never actually specify these labels.&#8221; What&#8217;s not cool is how prejudiced embeddings might be deployed&#8212;when sorting r&#233;sum&#233;s or loan applications, say. For example, if a computer searching r&#233;sum&#233;s for computer programmers associates &#8220;programmer&#8221; with men, mens&#8217; r&#233;sum&#233;s will pop to the top. Bolukbasi\'s work focuses on ways to &#8220;debias&#8221; embeddings&#8212;that is, removing unwanted associations from them.</p>\n\n<p>Bryson has another take. Instead of debiasing embeddings, essentially throwing away information, she prefers adding an extra layer of human or computer judgement to decide how or whether to act on such biases. In the case of hiring programmers, you might decide to set gender quotas.</p>\n\n<p>People have long suggested that meaning could plausibly be extracted through word cooccurrences, &#8220;but it was a far from a foregone conclusion,&#8221; says Anthony Greenwald, a psychologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who developed the IAT in 1998 and wrote a <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/133">commentary</a> on the WEAT paper for this week&#8217;s issue of <cite>Science</cite>. He says he expected that writing&#8212;the basis of the WEAT measurements&#8212;would better reflect explicit attitudes than implicit biases. But instead, the WEAT embeddings more closely resemble IAT biases than surveys about racial and gender attitudes, suggesting that we may convey prejudice through language in ways we don&#8217;t realize. &#8220;That was a bit surprising,&#8221; he says. He also says the WEAT might be used to test for implicit bias in past eras by testing word embeddings derived from, say, books written in the 1800s.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, Byron and her colleagues have also shown that even Google is not immune to bias. The company&#8217;s translation software converts gender-neutral pronouns from several languages into &#8220;he&#8221; when talking about a doctor, and &#8220;she&#8221; when talking about a nurse.</p>\n\n<p>All of this work &#8220;shows that it is important how you choose your words,&#8221; Bryson says. &#8220;To me, this is actually a vindication of political correctness and affirmative action and all these things. Now, I see how important it is.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Even artificial intelligence can acquire biases against race and gender" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

The approach relies on small quantities of vapor released from the common explosive TNT. Previously, researchers engineered <cite>Escherichia coli </cite>(pictured), a bacterial species abundant in the environment and in mammalian intestines, to glow green upon detection of DNT, a byproduct of TNT. In a study published in <cite>Nature Biotechnology</cite> today, the same team reports on a small field test with mines buried in sand and soil, whose triggering mechanisms were removed. The scientists loaded about 100,000 DNT-detecting bacterial cells into a single bead made of polymers derived from seaweed and sprinkled these beads over the landmine site at night. Twenty-four hours later, they used a laser to remotely detect and quantify fluorescing bacteria from 20 meters away, mapping the location of the landmines. The researchers tell <cite>Science</cite> that they have since improved their system to detect the explosives in only 3 hours and are programming the bacteria to have a limited life span to ease qualms about permanently releasing genetically engineered microbes in the environment. The team is careful to note that its trial was preliminary. For now, the technique is limited to small areas, but in the future a faster laser attached to a drone could scan larger swaths of land. The bacteria will also need to be optimized to find mines buried in rougher terrain, or ones that use explosives besides TNT.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Glowing bacteria detect buried landmines" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

When top researchers in Eastern Europe started joining high-power institutions in the West, the research suggests, their colleagues and students back home ended up with fewer cross-border connections. "I\'m quite surprised how big the effect is," says Paul Nightingale, a science policy expert at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who was not involved in the study. "These are worrying findings."</p>\n\n<p>The analysis is based on a natural experiment. In 2004, the European Union expanded by adding 10 member states, including Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. This made it much easier for people in these countries to find work and live in Western Europe. By tapping a government database on intra-European job moves, Alexander Petersen, a computational social scientist at the University of California, Merced, and his colleagues were able to infer the impact of the union\'s expansion on scientific mobility. The database records the international transfers of highly skilled workers, such as doctors and civil engineers, who need a professional certification in a new host country.</p>\n\n<p>It was easy to see the brain drain. Although most professionals hopped between neighboring countries, the percentage that left Eastern for Western Europe rose from 5% to 29% after 2005. Scientists aren\'t in the database, because they don\'t need government accreditation, but Petersen thinks the trend is likely the same. Other experts agree: "There is a lot of migration because of the high-quality infrastructure in universities in the West," says Peter Tindemans, secretary-general of EuroScience, a membership association of European researchers, based in Strasbourg, France. "Scientists gravitate to the places where they can do the best science." He says there is a similar pattern with European Research Council grants, which researchers can take along when they head to a new institution.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>To find out what happens when a researcher packs up for a new country, Petersen and his colleagues dug into a database of millions of scientific papers published between 1996 and 2012, looking at affiliations of the authors as a proxy for international research collaborations. After 2004,&#160;<a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/4/e1602232">the new member nations in the east experienced a drop in the proportion of papers published with international co-authors</a>&#160;(see chart), the team reports in the current issue of&#160;<cite>Science Advances</cite>.&#160;In contrast, this ratio increased in the older member nations.

When top scientists in Eastern Europe moved to institutions in Western Europe, they brought along their connections with scientists in other countries&#8212;say, a Hungarian molecular biologist with ongoing collaborations in France and Germany, who moves to the United Kingdom. "Good scientists tend to collaborate with other scientists abroad," says co-author Fabio Pammolli, an economist at the Polytechnic University of Milan in Italy. "This is part of the increasing integration of science." In addition, he notes, talented graduate students came to study in Western universities and built new contacts while working in internationally staffed labs. Meanwhile, their home countries had lost international connections.</p>\n\n<p>This migration and concentration of talent in research hubs is a natural part of scientific growth, the authors say. At the same time, they acknowledge that losing talent is bad for the home country. The tricky balance for policymakers is that the European Union wants its most gifted scientists to be able to chase opportunities and work in the best places, but it also wants equitable growth and development among its member nations&#8212;and having a strong science base is a proven part of economic development. "It\'s one of these traditional European problems," Tindemans says. "We will not find a clear answer."</p>\n\n<p>The European Union has tried to level the economic playing field by providing billions of euros as so-called Structural Funds to its less developed member nations. In the beginning, many funds were not spent well, Tindemans says, and the European Commission has since pushed for better accounting and for more of the funds to be invested in science and innovation. "If you spend it wisely, you could do great things with that money," Tindemans says, pointing to <a href="http://www.esfri.eu/success-stories/extreme-light-infrastructure-when-scientific-excellence-contributes-europe%E2%80%99s">new high-power laser facilities in Eastern Europe</a> that are being built largely with Structural Funds. But he says it will continue to be difficult for Eastern nations to compete with the advanced centers of research elsewhere. "It\'s impossible that you will have the same high-quality research universities all over Europe. There are too few people and not enough money."&#160;</p>\n\n<p>What is needed in the short term, the authors say, is more incentives for scientific talent to return to Eastern Europe after training and experience in the West. Petersen says the commission already has valuable programs that match scientists in Eastern Europe with Western institutions to build expertise, and fellowship programs for scientific mobility, such as the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/about/individual-fellowships_en">Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie actions</a>, include a &#160;mandatory 1-year return period.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Europe&#8217;s paradox: Why increased scientific mobility has not led to more international collaborations" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Now, it turns out that the jets contain hydrogen gas, a sign of ongoing reactions on the floor of that alien sea. Because such chemistry provides energy for microbial life on Earth, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/155">the discovery makes Enceladus the top candidate for hosting life elsewhere in the solar system</a>&#8212;besting even Jupiter&#8217;s Europa, another icy moon with an ocean. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t see microbes,&#8221; says Hunter Waite, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, and the lead author of a study published this week in <em>Science</em>. &#8220;But we saw their food.&#8221;</p>\n  \n  <figure class="figure__minimal entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-related-articles align-right"><article class="media media--var media--priority-2"><div class="media__icon">\n        \n  \n      <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/missions-last-hurrah-cassini-aims-solve-riddle-saturns-rings"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.sciencemag.org//www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/grid_thumb_-_290x163__16_9_/public/ca_0414NID_Cassini_Path_1280x720.jpg?itok=PbjRTulf" alt="An artist\'s conception of Cassini\'s orbit"></a>  \n      </div>\n    \n    <div class="media__body">\n              <h3 class="overline"></h3>\n      \n\n      \n      <h2 class="media__headline">\n        <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/missions-last-hurrah-cassini-aims-solve-riddle-saturns-rings">In mission\'s last hurrah, Cassini aims to solve riddle of Saturn\'s rings</a>\n      </h2>\n          </div>\n  </article></figure><p>In previous passes through the plumes, the Cassini team found organic molecules like methane and formaldehyde. A final pass in October 2015, just 48 kilometers above the surface, revealed something even more tantalizing: abundant hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>). The authors argue that it comes from hydrothermal activity on the ocean floor, perhaps seafloor vents like those on Earth that spew H<sub>2</sub>&#160;and support rich microbial life. It could be produced by water reacting with iron, or similar reactions baking out primitive organic molecules trapped in the rocky core.</p>\n\n<p>Waite and his colleagues were previously blind to hydrogen in the plumes because of surges of it created in their own instrument when water reacted with its titanium components. All the potential biases seem accounted for now, says Gabriel Tobie, a planetary scientist at the University of Nantes in France who was unaffiliated with the study. The high volume of hydrogen is a puzzle, as are spikes in its abundance, but it is not the only evidence of seafloor activity on Enceladus. In 2015, Cassini scientists studied particles from Saturn&#8217;s E ring, known to be fed by Enceladus&#8217;s plumes, and found tiny glass beads that could have only come from hydrothermal reactions. &#8220;These converging pieces of evidence tell us that something special is happening inside Enceladus,&#8221; Tobie says.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, NASA is pinning its hopes for life on Europa, with the $2 billion Europa Clipper planned for launch in the next decade. The Hubble telescope has seen signs of a plume on Europa erupting twice from the same spot, according to a study in this week&#8217;s issue of&#160;<em>The Astrophysical Journal</em>. But the signal is contested, and there&#8217;s no evidence yet of hydrothermal activity.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to second guess targets at all,&#8221; says Waite, who leads an instrument on the Clipper. But he thinks Enceladus is just begging to be sampled with a mission designed for the task.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Food for microbes abundant on Enceladus" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Consider gentoo penguins (<em>Pygoscelius papua</em>), which have a major breeding colony (image) on Ardley Island off the Antarctic peninsula. The orange-billed birds first appeared on the island about 6700 years ago, and previous studies indicate that the climate and sea surface temperatures in the region have been good to them thus far. But sediment cores drilled from a 7300-square-meter lake on the island&#8212;which today collects runoff that includes prodigious amounts of penguin guano as well as material eroded from the island&#8217;s bedrock&#8212;tell a different story. At three times since the birds arrived, major eruptions of a volcano on Deception Island, which lies about 120 kilometers away, have <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms14914">cloaked Ardley Island with centimeters-thick layers of ash</a> that later washed into the lake, the researchers report in <cite>Nature Communications</cite>. It&#8217;s not clear whether each of those ash layers chronicles a single large eruption or a closely spaced sequence of smaller ones. Regardless, guano-free followed by guano-poor sediments left in the wake of these three eruptions suggest that breeding penguins were wiped out&#8212;or abandoned the island for posteruption intervals ranging between 400 and 800 years. Thick layers of ash would have made it hard for the birds to breathe, compromised the immune systems of adult and hatchling penguins, and may have prevented adults from collecting pebbles that they needed to construct their nests, the researchers suggest.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Volcanic eruptions may have periodically wiped out Antarctic penguin colonies" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Fewer than 300 of these great cats remain in the forest, where they are confined to small patches of jungle surrounded by cities and farmland. So it was &#8220;the most beautiful thing in the world,&#8221; when Beatriz Beisiegel captured rare footage of a healthy female jaguar followed by her two cubs in December 2016 in Carlos Botelho State Park. The trio passed the camera trap not once, but at least three times, the last with full bellies. This is the first time that Beisiegel, a biologist with the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation in Bras&#237;lia, has seen a cub in her 12 years monitoring jaguars in the dense jungles of the Ribeira Valley, in southern S&#227;o Paulo state. The sighting is especially encouraging, given the constant threat of poaching in these encroached forests. Just last month, another jaguar was illegally shot and killed on nearby private lands by hunters who bragged about the deed in a <a href="http://g1.globo.com/sp/santos-regiao/noticia/2017/03/cacadores-matam-onca-debocham-do-animal-e-video-causa-revolta-veja.html">viral internet video</a>. Beisiegel says she hopes her videos will inspire others to protect jaguars and reject a bill currently moving through the Brazilian Congress that would legalize the sport hunting of wild animals. Appropriately enough, she has&#160;given an apt name to the female jaguar: Hope.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="This rare footage of jaguar cubs is inspiring hope for Brazil&#8217;s endangered cat" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

Geophysicists in Iceland were studying volcanic tremors&#8212;rapidly repeating mini-earthquakes thought to come from magma moving underground&#8212;when they noticed something odd. Looking at data from Hekla Volcano, they found one tremor that arose, not from the volcano, but from a passing helicopter. As their rotor blades spin, helicopters create a series of closely spaced pressure pulses that travel through the air to the ground below. These pulses appear merged as a single tremor, which can be picked up by seismometers up to 40 kilometers away, depending on topography and wind. Seismic tremors have already been recorded for other phenomena&#8212;including floods, mud flows, and icebergs&#8212;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggx048">but this is the first time they have been detected for an aircraft</a>, the researchers report in <cite>Geophysical Journal International</cite>. To explore the signals further&#8212;and ensure helicopters aren&#8217;t mistaken for volcanoes&#8212;the team recorded tremors from a helicopter flying through a network of seven seismometers. By measuring the changing frequency of the signals as the chopper passed each one, the researchers determined the approximate location, altitude, speed, and flight direction of the craft. As most choppers don&#8217;t vary rotor speed during flight, the researchers were even able to use tremor frequencies to deduce the number of rotor blades and their revolution speed. With enough information on different helicopter specs, it might be possible to determine the model of chopper, the researchers say. And though the study looked only at helicopters, in principle the new approach could also track any rotor- or propeller-based craft, including drones.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Earthquake detectors can pick up helicopters, too" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

That can&#8217;t be done with humans, but some people are natural knockouts&#8212;born missing one or more genes. Now, a look at the DNA of 10,500 Pakistanis has found more than 1300 genes that are knocked out without causing obvious medical issues. The results may help confirm why a new heart disease drug flopped in clinical trials, and why another new drug should work just fine.</p>\n\n<p>The study is the latest of several hunts for apparently healthy human knockouts that have included <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/03/one-thousand-genes-you-could-live-without">Iceland</a> and the United Kingdom. &#8220;The Human Genome Project gave us a parts list of 18,000 genes, and this project is trying to understand what missing a part means in terms of biological consequences,&#8221; says heart disease geneticist Sekar Kathiresan of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who co-led the study.</p>\n\n<p>In Pakistan, people often marry their first cousins. That raises the odds that a mother and father will both pass identical copies of a mutation in a specific gene to their children. (Unless the mutated gene is on a sex chromosome, both parental copies of a gene have to be disabled for a full knockout.) Kathiresan&#8217;s group sequenced the DNA of 10,503 Pakistanis who are participating in a long-term heart disease and diabetes study and found 1317 fully knocked-out genes. The team then looked for abnormalities in about 200 clinical blood biomarkers such as cholesterol.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature22034">Seven genes were disabled in at least two people</a> and clearly matched up with some biomarker change, such as unusually low insulin levels, the team reports today in <cite>Nature</cite>. One codes for an enzyme called Lp-PLA2 that has been linked to arterial plaque. Because higher blood levels of Lp-PLA2 correlate with more heart attacks, drug companies have already spent billions of dollars on Lp-PLA2&#8211;blocking drugs. But Pakistanis who lacked one or both copies of the gene didn&#8217;t have a lower risk of heart disease, which adds to <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160615102425.htm">other genetics studies that may explain why these drugs failed in the clinic</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the study found strong support for another heart disease drug target, a protein called ApoC-III that <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/10/why-lucky-few-can-eat-their-hearts-content">limits the body&#8217;s ability to metabolize fats called triglycerides</a>. Although Kathiresan&#8217;s team has studied people missing one copy of the <em>APCO3</em> gene, &#8220;we\'ve been looking for the past 4 years for humans who completely lack it.&#8221; They had found none in the United States and Europe, he says, but in Pakistan, his group identified a whole family where both parents and all nine of their children lack the <em>APCO3</em> gene.</p>\n\n<p>When the family members drank a fat-laden milkshake, their blood fat levels barely rose, suggesting they have little artery-clogging fat in their bodies and should be protected against heart attacks. The family also seemed perfectly healthy, so ApoC-III&#8211;blocking drugs now in clinical testing should be safe, Kathiresan predicts. The drugs could eventually join <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/03/20/what-pcsk9-is-telling-us-about-drug-discovery">another heart disease&#8211;preventing drug</a> that came out of the discovery of a healthy woman missing a gene called <em>PCSK9</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The Pakistani study is the first in which researchers tested some of the knockouts they had found to learn more about their health, says human geneticist David Van Heel of Queen Mary University of London, who last year published a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/human-knockouts-reveal-genes-we-don-t-need">smaller knockout study of British-Pakistanis</a>. Because these individuals are so rare, &#8220;we really all need to keep going to sequence more and more people,&#8221; he says. About 200,000 Pakistanis would be enough to find knockouts of about 8700 genes, Kathiresan&#8217;s team estimates. (Some of these genes are essential to early development, however, so a human knockout would never be born.)</p>\n\n<p>Kathiresan and others is now calling for a Human Knockout Project that would pool all the data coming out of these projects and other large population genetics studies in a single database. Co-author Daniel MacArthur of the Broad Institute will soon release a prototype containing knocked-out genes <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/a-radical-revision-of-human-genetics-1.20779">from a larger collection of human genomes called ExAC</a>. Eventually the plan is to make it possible for academic researchers&#8212;and drug companies&#8212;to reach out to the&#160;leaders of the original study so they can&#160;contact an individual knockout from the database and bring the person into a clinic for more testing.&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Human &#8216;knockouts&#8217; may reveal why some drugs fail" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

The report&#8217;s key recommendation is that universities and scientific societies create, operate, and fund a new, independent, nongovernmental Research Integrity Advisory Board (RIAB). The board would serve as a clearinghouse to raise awareness of the issues, as an honest broker to mediate disagreements, and as a beacon to help institutions that lack the knowledge or resources to root out bad behavior and foster good behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Other entities are already doing these things, but none has research integrity as its sole focus nor covers so much territory. Federal funding agencies investigate and punish miscreants who misuse taxpayer dollars, universities train scientists as part of their mission to advance knowledge, and scientific societies and journals have adopted ethical standards for their authors and members. After reviewing that landscape, the committee concluded that all of those organizations need to step up their game.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n      <p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t think the system is broken, but we think there is a lot more we as a community can do,&#8221; says Robert Nerem, professor emeritus of bioengineering at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta and chair of <a href="http://www8.nationalacademies.org/cp/projectview.aspx?key=49387">the committee that wrote the report.</a></p>\n\n<p>And Nerem doesn&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any time to waste. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t do better, Congress could step in&#8221; and act unilaterally, he warns. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t think Congress [would have] the best interests of the research enterprise at heart in moving forward. Some legislators are champions of research, but I would be leery of what would come out of Congress.&#8221;</p>\n\n<h2>A long, hard slog</h2>\n\n<p>The committee began its work in 2012 with the goal of updating a 1992 National Academies&#160;report, <em><a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/1864/responsible-science-volume-i-ensuring-the-integrity-of-the-research">Responsible Science</a></em>, which made a similar pitch for an advisory body. (It went unheeded.)&#160;The 1992 report was prompted by a wave of research misconduct cases that soiled science&#8217;s reputation and led to the creation of the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) to investigate misconduct involving federally funded biomedical research.</p>\n\n<p>But what began as a 2-year project wound up taking quite a bit longer. &#8220;The research enterprise has grown a lot in the past 25 years,&#8221; Nerem says, adding that the rise in interdisciplinary research, new technologies, concerns about reproducibility, and increased international collaboration have made research integrity a much more complex issue. The committee almost&#160;ran out of money at one point, and the exhaustive internal vetting process given every Academies&#160;report took even longer than usual.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the widespread adoption of ethical standards by the scientific community, research misconduct continues to be a thorn in the side of the scientific community. ORI and its counterpart at the National Science Foundation (NSF) receive hundreds of allegations every year, which result in dozens of findings of misconduct.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than hiding its head in the sand, the committee decided that self-examination might help the community do its job better. An appendix to its report includes five notorious cases, including one several years ago at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/11/potti-found-guilty-research-misconduct">involving fabrication by cancer researcher Anil Potti</a>, in which Nerem says the school&#8217;s response to allegations of misconduct was as flawed as the behavior itself. &#8220;As good a research institution as Duke is, clearly, they fell down on the job,&#8221; Nerem says.</p>\n\n<p>Although ORI concluded the Potti investigation in 2015, Nerem says he&#8217;s not convinced the institution has learned its lesson. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if Duke has changed its practices, but it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if it happened again,&#8221; he says. &#8220;After all, people are only human.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The best way to reduce the number of such ugly incidents, Nerem believes, is for top university officials to make clear that training in the responsible conduct of research (RCR) is a priority at their institution. And that&#8217;s where the proposed advisory board could help.</p>\n\n<p>A creation of the community, the RIAB would &#8220;have no direct role in investigations, regulation, or accreditation,&#8221; the report says. Nor would it set enforceable standards for the profession. But Nerem and others believe that the board&#8217;s focus on fostering ethical behavior could encourage institutions to pay more attention to the issue.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="graphic entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-figure"><h3 class="graphic__header">Less than the best</h3>\n  <div class="graphic__body">\n<p>A new review of 91 universities found that few require more than an online course for research ethics training.</p>\n</div>\n\n  \n      <figure class="figure"><img sizes="" src="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/gg_SVG_RIR_4%20%281%29.png?itok=C4jaQ9Er" srcset="http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__450w__no_aspect/public/gg_SVG_RIR_4%20%281%29.png?itok=C4jaQ9Er 1w, http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/inline__699w__no_aspect/public/gg_SVG_RIR_4%20%281%29.png?itok=o4IdlsWA 700w"><figcaption><div class="caption"></div>\n      <div class="credit">\n  \n      CREDITS: (GRAPHIC) G.

(and former&#160;<cite>Science</cite>&#160;editor-in-chief), thinks the board could be especially helpful to small institutions. &#8220;I see it as the great equalizer,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Big research organizations are well-oiled machines, but a smaller organization may not know how to proceed with an investigation or create an RCR training program.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Another way to improve the quality of investigations would be to subject them to external peer review. &#8220;We do it for journal articles, and for grant proposals, so why not use outside experts on investigations as well?&#8221; Nerem asks.</p>\n\n<p>The committee looked at various mechanisms for establishing the board and decided that it should sit outside the federal umbrella. &#8220;Most universities feel they are already being micromanaged by the government, and having this board be part of [the federal bureaucracy] might reinforce that,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n<p>McNutt sees another reason for its independence. &#8220;The federal government has been slow to adopt best practices on research integrity,&#8221; she says. &#8220;So I&#8217;m not surprised that the committee feels that it would be better for the board to be independent.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The makeup and location of the board would be up to its founding members, who would also finance its operations. The panel proposed that the board have an annual budget of $3 million, with the money coming from federal agencies, foundations, and universities. Academic institutions would pay dues on a sliding scale based on how much research they perform.</p>\n\n<p>McNutt says that the National Academies might consider a request to provide physical space for the board but that otherwise her organization would remain at arm&#8217;s length. That would also allow the Academies to carry out an independent evaluation of the board&#8217;s activities if it were asked to do so, she adds.&#160;</p>\n\n<h2>More than a checklist</h2>\n\n<p>Coincidentally, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-017-9883-5">a new study in <em>Science and Engineering Ethics</em></a> highlights some gaps in training that the board might address. In 2007, Congress ordered NSF&#160;to require every grant application to include a plan for RCR training of all postdoctoral researchers, undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers who would be participating in the proposed research. But the study finds that most universities have adopted bare bones programs that appear tailored to simply comply with the requirement rather than to truly educate the next generation of scientists by following best practices in the field. Most consist of online instruction rather than face-to-face interaction (see graph, above), deliver a single &#8220;dose&#8221; rather than ongoing ethics training, and take a one-size-fits-all approach that doesn&#8217;t differentiate by discipline or the student&#8217;s academic status.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;If you think of [RCR] as compliance, you&#8217;re missing the boat,&#8221; says medical ethicist Elizabeth Heitman of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, a co-author of the study. &#8220;The problem is that it&#8217;s become a checklist.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The authors suggest that NSF also shoulders some responsibility for the current situation. NSF doesn&#8217;t require institutions to document that they are actually providing the training, giving them broad latitude to design their programs. Nor does NSF do any systematic monitoring of those efforts. In response, an agency spokesperson says that &#8220;NSF believes that &#8230; education in [RCR] is essential in the preparation of future scientists and engineers.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Heitman believes the fundamental problem is that many universities view ethics training as an add-on rather than as part of their core mission. That leads to a cascade of poor practices, she says, including leaving the training to others, doing it on the cheap, and dropping it when a funding agency no longer requires it to win a grant. &#8220;We don&#8217;t outsource biostatistics or biochemistry education, but we think differently about ethics and research integrity,&#8221; she laments.&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n<p>The impact of federal research policies on research integrity could be another ripe area for the new board to examine, notes the Academies&#160;report. Increasing competition for funding and the need for high-profile publications in order to win academic promotion can generate &#8220;detrimental research practices&#8221; that fall short of the federal definition of misconduct as fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism but nevertheless stray from acceptable norms.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The ultimate goal of the board,&#8221; says McNutt, &#8220;would be to create a climate in which we never have to investigate research misconduct because it never occurs.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="U.S. report calls for research integrity board" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>',

It&#8217;s time to place your bets, for NASA&#8217;s Cassini spacecraft, which has spent the past 13 years exploring the planet and its moons, is finally swooping close enough to take a look.</p>\n\n<p>On 26 April, it will thread the gap between the gas giant and its rings in the first of 22 week-long orbits that will culminate in September with a fiery and fatal plunge into the atmosphere. The Grand Finale, as NASA is calling the forays, should help answer questions about Saturn&#8217;s atmosphere and interior. But most of all, it should end a debate about the mass of the water ice rings, which is a big clue to their age&#8212;whether they are 4.5 billion years old, nearly as old as the planet, or much younger. The Cassini team has a betting pool on the mass: $5 a wager, due before the first orbit.</p>\n\n<p>The route will be dangerous. The gap contains ice particles finer than soot, which ought not to harm the spacecraft. But if the models are wrong, and Cassini collides at 122,000 kilometers per hour with something even as large as a BB, the mission will end early. &#8220;This is something we wouldn&#8217;t want to try at another time,&#8221; says Earl Maize, the Cassini program manager at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) in Pasadena, California. To be cautious, on its first pass, Cassini will hide behind its large antenna, using it as a shield to protect its instruments.</p>\n\n<p>As the spacecraft plunges toward the rings in subsequent orbits, a radio telescope in Argentina will be listening for tiny Doppler shifts in Cassini&#8217;s signal. Those will allow the team to tease out the gravitational pull of the rings from that of Saturn&#8212;a distinction that could not be made when Cassini was orbiting outside the rings, says Luciano Iess, a planetary scientist at the Sapienza University of Rome. The measurement could provide a verdict on the rings&#8217; mass&#8212;and their age.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, many scientists have assumed that the rings are nearly as old as Saturn itself&#8212;massive structures formed of icy planetary building blocks. Early on, Cassini showed the B ring, one of four main rings, to be bright and nearly opaque, bolstering the view that the ice particles are dense and that the rings have a total mass greater than Saturn&#8217;s 400-kilometer-wide moon, Mimas.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="figure__minimal entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-related-articles align-right"><article class="media media--var media--priority-2"><div class="media__icon">\n        \n  \n      <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/food-microbes-abundant-enceladus"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.sciencemag.org//www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/grid_thumb_-_290x163__16_9_/public/4852_PIA11688_1280x720.jpg?itok=lNtM6FkI" alt="An image of Enceladus plumes"></a>  \n      </div>\n    \n    <div class="media__body">\n              <h3 class="overline"></h3>\n      \n\n      \n      <h2 class="media__headline">\n        <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/food-microbes-abundant-enceladus">Food for microbes abundant on Enceladus</a>\n      </h2>\n          </div>\n  </article></figure><p>But an alternate view is gaining credence: that the rings are more delicate structures formed within the last 100 million years from the smashed ice of a lost moon. An age of 4.5 billion years is hard to reconcile with their pristine color, because a steady stream of sooty micrometeoroids from interplanetary space should have darkened them by now, like drops of black ink spreading in a pool of white paint. Moreover, the spacing between rippling, spiral waves within the rings, created by gravitational resonances with Saturn&#8217;s moons, can offer another clue to mass, and judging from a handful of wavelets recently spied within the bright B ring, it is low. Iess believes the total mass of the rings to be just 20% to 80% of Mimas.</p>\n\n<p>Cassini may reveal another clue when its close passage gives it the best view yet of the interior C and D rings. Amid the C ring&#8217;s icy particles, there are hints of larger chunks of rubble, says Jeff Cuzzi, a ring specialist at NASA&#8217;s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, who believes the rings are young. &#8220;This could even be the core of the object that formed the rings.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>By catching stray ring particles, the spacecraft could also learn more about the makeup of the rings themselves, which are at least 90% water ice. Their distinctive shade of taupe could come from reddish iron oxide or carotene, the orange of carrots.</p>\n\n<p>As the spacecraft&#8217;s orbits take it ever closer to Saturn itself, it will shift its attention from the rings to the planet&#8217;s roiling ammonia clouds. Its cameras should see the structure of storms, and shadows could reveal the architecture of sharp lines of clouds that may extend for several thousand kilometers. Close-up measurements of the planet&#8217;s magnetic field could finally reveal the length of a day on Saturn. With no solid surface to define a day, scientists hope to use periodic patterns in Saturn&#8217;s magnetic field to get at the rotation of its interior.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in the last five orbits, &#8220;we&#8217;re going to dip our toe into the atmosphere of Saturn,&#8221; says Linda Spilker, the Cassini project scientist at JPL. It will be the first time humanity has sampled the atmosphere of a gas giant since the Galileo spacecraft dropped a probe into Jupiter in 1995. If they get lucky, researchers could estimate the abundances of helium and hydrogen in Saturn&#8217;s outer layers, which, in turn, could help illuminate its interior structure and how gas giants form.</p>\n\n<p>On its final dive into Saturn, on 15 September, Cassini will point its antenna to Earth, but the spacecraft should go silent quickly, vaporizing within 3 minutes. Planners deemed it necessary to destroy Cassini rather than leave it wandering near Saturn because it may carry stowaway terrestrial microbes that could contaminate two Saturn moons, Titan and Enceladus, that have potentially habitable conditions.</p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s much to do before then. Cuzzi, though he favors youthful, low-mass rings, hasn&#8217;t gotten his bet into the pool yet. He&#8217;s waiting until the last minute. &#8220;I know time is getting short.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="In mission\'s last hurrah, Cassini aims to solve riddle of Saturn\'s rings" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Now, it turns out that the jets contain hydrogen gas, a sign of ongoing reactions on the floor of that alien sea. Because such chemistry provides energy for microbial life on Earth, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/155">the discovery makes Enceladus the top candidate for hosting life elsewhere in the solar system</a>&#8212;besting even Jupiter&#8217;s Europa, another icy moon with an ocean. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t see microbes,&#8221; says Hunter Waite, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, and the lead author of a study published this week in <em>Science</em>. &#8220;But we saw their food.&#8221;</p>\n  \n  <figure class="figure__minimal entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-related-articles align-right"><article class="media media--var media--priority-2"><div class="media__icon">\n        \n  \n      <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/missions-last-hurrah-cassini-aims-solve-riddle-saturns-rings"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.sciencemag.org//www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/grid_thumb_-_290x163__16_9_/public/ca_0414NID_Cassini_Path_1280x720.jpg?itok=PbjRTulf" alt="An artist\'s conception of Cassini\'s orbit"></a>  \n      </div>\n    \n    <div class="media__body">\n              <h3 class="overline"></h3>\n      \n\n      \n      <h2 class="media__headline">\n        <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/missions-last-hurrah-cassini-aims-solve-riddle-saturns-rings">In mission\'s last hurrah, Cassini aims to solve riddle of Saturn\'s rings</a>\n      </h2>\n          </div>\n  </article></figure><p>In previous passes through the plumes, the Cassini team found organic molecules like methane and formaldehyde. A final pass in October 2015, just 48 kilometers above the surface, revealed something even more tantalizing: abundant hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>). The authors argue that it comes from hydrothermal activity on the ocean floor, perhaps seafloor vents like those on Earth that spew H<sub>2</sub>&#160;and support rich microbial life. It could be produced by water reacting with iron, or similar reactions baking out primitive organic molecules trapped in the rocky core.</p>\n\n<p>Waite and his colleagues were previously blind to hydrogen in the plumes because of surges of it created in their own instrument when water reacted with its titanium components. All the potential biases seem accounted for now, says Gabriel Tobie, a planetary scientist at the University of Nantes in France who was unaffiliated with the study. The high volume of hydrogen is a puzzle, as are spikes in its abundance, but it is not the only evidence of seafloor activity on Enceladus. In 2015, Cassini scientists studied particles from Saturn&#8217;s E ring, known to be fed by Enceladus&#8217;s plumes, and found tiny glass beads that could have only come from hydrothermal reactions. &#8220;These converging pieces of evidence tell us that something special is happening inside Enceladus,&#8221; Tobie says.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, NASA is pinning its hopes for life on Europa, with the $2 billion Europa Clipper planned for launch in the next decade. The Hubble telescope has seen signs of a plume on Europa erupting twice from the same spot, according to a study in this week&#8217;s issue of&#160;<em>The Astrophysical Journal</em>. But the signal is contested, and there&#8217;s no evidence yet of hydrothermal activity.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to second guess targets at all,&#8221; says Waite, who leads an instrument on the Clipper. But he thinks Enceladus is just begging to be sampled with a mission designed for the task.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Food for microbes abundant on Enceladus" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

It&#8217;s time to place your bets, for NASA&#8217;s Cassini spacecraft, which has spent the past 13 years exploring the planet and its moons, is finally swooping close enough to take a look.</p>\n\n<p>On 26 April, it will thread the gap between the gas giant and its rings in the first of 22 week-long orbits that will culminate in September with a fiery and fatal plunge into the atmosphere. The Grand Finale, as NASA is calling the forays, should help answer questions about Saturn&#8217;s atmosphere and interior. But most of all, it should end a debate about the mass of the water ice rings, which is a big clue to their age&#8212;whether they are 4.5 billion years old, nearly as old as the planet, or much younger. The Cassini team has a betting pool on the mass: $5 a wager, due before the first orbit.</p>\n\n<p>The route will be dangerous. The gap contains ice particles finer than soot, which ought not to harm the spacecraft. But if the models are wrong, and Cassini collides at 122,000 kilometers per hour with something even as large as a BB, the mission will end early. &#8220;This is something we wouldn&#8217;t want to try at another time,&#8221; says Earl Maize, the Cassini program manager at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) in Pasadena, California. To be cautious, on its first pass, Cassini will hide behind its large antenna, using it as a shield to protect its instruments.</p>\n\n<p>As the spacecraft plunges toward the rings in subsequent orbits, a radio telescope in Argentina will be listening for tiny Doppler shifts in Cassini&#8217;s signal. Those will allow the team to tease out the gravitational pull of the rings from that of Saturn&#8212;a distinction that could not be made when Cassini was orbiting outside the rings, says Luciano Iess, a planetary scientist at the Sapienza University of Rome. The measurement could provide a verdict on the rings&#8217; mass&#8212;and their age.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, many scientists have assumed that the rings are nearly as old as Saturn itself&#8212;massive structures formed of icy planetary building blocks. Early on, Cassini showed the B ring, one of four main rings, to be bright and nearly opaque, bolstering the view that the ice particles are dense and that the rings have a total mass greater than Saturn&#8217;s 400-kilometer-wide moon, Mimas.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="figure__minimal entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-related-articles align-right"><article class="media media--var media--priority-2"><div class="media__icon">\n        \n  \n      <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/food-microbes-abundant-enceladus"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.sciencemag.org//www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/grid_thumb_-_290x163__16_9_/public/4852_PIA11688_1280x720.jpg?itok=lNtM6FkI" alt="An image of Enceladus plumes"></a>  \n      </div>\n    \n    <div class="media__body">\n              <h3 class="overline"></h3>\n      \n\n      \n      <h2 class="media__headline">\n        <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/food-microbes-abundant-enceladus">Food for microbes abundant on Enceladus</a>\n      </h2>\n          </div>\n  </article></figure><p>But an alternate view is gaining credence: that the rings are more delicate structures formed within the last 100 million years from the smashed ice of a lost moon. An age of 4.5 billion years is hard to reconcile with their pristine color, because a steady stream of sooty micrometeoroids from interplanetary space should have darkened them by now, like drops of black ink spreading in a pool of white paint. Moreover, the spacing between rippling, spiral waves within the rings, created by gravitational resonances with Saturn&#8217;s moons, can offer another clue to mass, and judging from a handful of wavelets recently spied within the bright B ring, it is low. Iess believes the total mass of the rings to be just 20% to 80% of Mimas.</p>\n\n<p>Cassini may reveal another clue when its close passage gives it the best view yet of the interior C and D rings. Amid the C ring&#8217;s icy particles, there are hints of larger chunks of rubble, says Jeff Cuzzi, a ring specialist at NASA&#8217;s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, who believes the rings are young. &#8220;This could even be the core of the object that formed the rings.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>By catching stray ring particles, the spacecraft could also learn more about the makeup of the rings themselves, which are at least 90% water ice. Their distinctive shade of taupe could come from reddish iron oxide or carotene, the orange of carrots.</p>\n\n<p>As the spacecraft&#8217;s orbits take it ever closer to Saturn itself, it will shift its attention from the rings to the planet&#8217;s roiling ammonia clouds. Its cameras should see the structure of storms, and shadows could reveal the architecture of sharp lines of clouds that may extend for several thousand kilometers. Close-up measurements of the planet&#8217;s magnetic field could finally reveal the length of a day on Saturn. With no solid surface to define a day, scientists hope to use periodic patterns in Saturn&#8217;s magnetic field to get at the rotation of its interior.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in the last five orbits, &#8220;we&#8217;re going to dip our toe into the atmosphere of Saturn,&#8221; says Linda Spilker, the Cassini project scientist at JPL. It will be the first time humanity has sampled the atmosphere of a gas giant since the Galileo spacecraft dropped a probe into Jupiter in 1995. If they get lucky, researchers could estimate the abundances of helium and hydrogen in Saturn&#8217;s outer layers, which, in turn, could help illuminate its interior structure and how gas giants form.</p>\n\n<p>On its final dive into Saturn, on 15 September, Cassini will point its antenna to Earth, but the spacecraft should go silent quickly, vaporizing within 3 minutes. Planners deemed it necessary to destroy Cassini rather than leave it wandering near Saturn because it may carry stowaway terrestrial microbes that could contaminate two Saturn moons, Titan and Enceladus, that have potentially habitable conditions.</p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s much to do before then. Cuzzi, though he favors youthful, low-mass rings, hasn&#8217;t gotten his bet into the pool yet. He&#8217;s waiting until the last minute. &#8220;I know time is getting short.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="In mission\'s last hurrah, Cassini aims to solve riddle of Saturn\'s rings" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Now, it turns out that the jets contain hydrogen gas, a sign of ongoing reactions on the floor of that alien sea. Because such chemistry provides energy for microbial life on Earth, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/155">the discovery makes Enceladus the top candidate for hosting life elsewhere in the solar system</a>&#8212;besting even Jupiter&#8217;s Europa, another icy moon with an ocean. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t see microbes,&#8221; says Hunter Waite, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, and the lead author of a study published this week in <em>Science</em>. &#8220;But we saw their food.&#8221;</p>\n  \n  <figure class="figure__minimal entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-related-articles align-right"><article class="media media--var media--priority-2"><div class="media__icon">\n        \n  \n      <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/missions-last-hurrah-cassini-aims-solve-riddle-saturns-rings"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.sciencemag.org//www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/grid_thumb_-_290x163__16_9_/public/ca_0414NID_Cassini_Path_1280x720.jpg?itok=PbjRTulf" alt="An artist\'s conception of Cassini\'s orbit"></a>  \n      </div>\n    \n    <div class="media__body">\n              <h3 class="overline"></h3>\n      \n\n      \n      <h2 class="media__headline">\n        <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/missions-last-hurrah-cassini-aims-solve-riddle-saturns-rings">In mission\'s last hurrah, Cassini aims to solve riddle of Saturn\'s rings</a>\n      </h2>\n          </div>\n  </article></figure><p>In previous passes through the plumes, the Cassini team found organic molecules like methane and formaldehyde. A final pass in October 2015, just 48 kilometers above the surface, revealed something even more tantalizing: abundant hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>). The authors argue that it comes from hydrothermal activity on the ocean floor, perhaps seafloor vents like those on Earth that spew H<sub>2</sub>&#160;and support rich microbial life. It could be produced by water reacting with iron, or similar reactions baking out primitive organic molecules trapped in the rocky core.</p>\n\n<p>Waite and his colleagues were previously blind to hydrogen in the plumes because of surges of it created in their own instrument when water reacted with its titanium components. All the potential biases seem accounted for now, says Gabriel Tobie, a planetary scientist at the University of Nantes in France who was unaffiliated with the study. The high volume of hydrogen is a puzzle, as are spikes in its abundance, but it is not the only evidence of seafloor activity on Enceladus. In 2015, Cassini scientists studied particles from Saturn&#8217;s E ring, known to be fed by Enceladus&#8217;s plumes, and found tiny glass beads that could have only come from hydrothermal reactions. &#8220;These converging pieces of evidence tell us that something special is happening inside Enceladus,&#8221; Tobie says.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, NASA is pinning its hopes for life on Europa, with the $2 billion Europa Clipper planned for launch in the next decade. The Hubble telescope has seen signs of a plume on Europa erupting twice from the same spot, according to a study in this week&#8217;s issue of&#160;<em>The Astrophysical Journal</em>. But the signal is contested, and there&#8217;s no evidence yet of hydrothermal activity.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to second guess targets at all,&#8221; says Waite, who leads an instrument on the Clipper. But he thinks Enceladus is just begging to be sampled with a mission designed for the task.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Food for microbes abundant on Enceladus" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

K. Singh<i> et al</i>., Phys. Rev. B (2017)</div>\n</div>\n<figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption></figure><p>Being flat isn&#8217;t always boring, as many materials take on a new life when reduced to two dimensions. Certain properties&#8212;such as large magnetoresistance or piezoelectricity&#8212;only appear in the 2D version of a material, so there&#8217;s a potential payoff for finding new 2D phases. Using a &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; algorithm, a research team has explored hypothetical 2D structures of oxides consisting of group-IV elements: silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb). They uncover three possibly stable 2D phases and predict their electrical properties.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most familiar 2D material, graphene, is a single layer of carbon, with the same crystal structure as the layers in its 3D counterpart, graphite. By contrast, other materials have stable 2D forms that are structurally distinct from their 3D bulk forms. For example, researchers have recently synthesized 2D <span class="aps-inline-formula"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>SiO</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></math></span> with a bi-tetrahedral crystal structure, whereas the 3D form (<span class="aps-inline-formula"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>&#120572;</mi></mrow></math></span> quartz) has a trigonal structure. To foresee other 2D group IV oxides, Richard Hennig from the University of Florida, Gainesville, and his colleagues utilized a so-called genetic algorithm that starts off with a random population of candidate structures and then lets them evolve to the most energetically favorable configuration.

Now, Kavan Modi from Monash University in Australia and colleagues have added another perk to &#8220;going quantum&#8221;: faster battery charging. The team considered a model for a nanoscale battery with quantized energy states. They found that the charging time can be reduced if multiple copies of this quantum battery interact with each other, but that, surprisingly, it&#8217;s not necessary that the battery states be entangled. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The transfer of energy into and out of a battery obeys certain thermodynamic bounds. However, these bounds may be altered if the battery is so small as to have quantized energy transitions between internal states. Recent studies have shown that more power can be extracted from a quantum battery when several copies of the battery are placed together and allowed to interact. Modi and his collaborators looked at the reverse process&#8212;charging quantum batteries.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The team imagined several identical quantum batteries, each being transferred from an initial low-energy state to a higher-energy (charged) state by the work of some external field. Previous research on so-called &#8220;quantum speed limits&#8221; has found that the time needed to go from initial to final quantum states can be shortened when different subsystems&#8212;batteries in this case&#8212;interact with each other. This interaction could, for example, try to align the spin states of nearby batteries, but it wouldn&#8217;t necessarily need to entangle them. In a more generic case, the team showed that <i>N</i> quantum batteries in a statistical mixture of nonentangled states can be charged <i>N</i> times faster with an interactive as opposed to an independent charging method.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This research is published in <i><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/">Physical Review Letters</a></i>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>&#8211;Michael Schirber</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Michael Schirber is a Corresponding Editor for <i><a href="https://physics.aps.org">Physics </a></i>based in Lyon, France.</p>\n<hr class="wave">\n<div class="show-for-small-only hide-for-print">\n<section class="panel"><div class="link-list-item">\n<h4><a href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.150601">Enhancing the Charging Power of Quantum Batteries</a></h4>\n<p>Francesco Campaioli, Felix A.

Beams (2017)</div>\n</div>\n<figcaption class="figure-caption"></figcaption></figure><p>Proton and ion therapies are the preferred treatment for many cancers, such as tumors that are deep within the body. All of the nearly 100 worldwide facilities that offer this treatment use cyclotrons or synchrotrons to accelerate the charged particles to the necessary energies. Compared to these circular machines, linear accelerators (linacs) offer certain advantages for treatment, but in addition to several design challenges, their large footprint is difficult to accommodate in hospitals. Stefano Benedetti and colleagues from CERN in Switzerland describe the first fully linear design that overcomes this size problem.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What makes linacs preferable to circular accelerators is that the energies of their output beams can be adjusted rapidly (in milliseconds) and without loss of beam intensity. The beam energy determines how deeply the protons or ions will penetrate into tissue, so this tunability is useful for adjusting the beam position within the body as the patient breathes or to precisely hit different spots on a tumor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Over the last few decades, researchers have explored various linac schemes. One of these, known as TULIP, coupled a linac to a cyclotron and achieved a compact footprint by winding a segment of the accelerator around the patient area. Benedetti and colleagues have conceptualized an &#8220;all-linac&#8221; version of TULIP that eliminates some of the technical complications of the hybrid model. Their design builds on developments such as improved radio-frequency technologies for injecting the particles into the machine and for accelerating them, and new particle-tracking methods.

To echolocate, they emit ultrasound calls and listen for echoes of those calls as they bounce off objects in the environment. Researchers know that the morphology of a bat&#8217;s nose and ears may help it to aim its calls and detect the direction from which the echoes originate, but they don\'t fully understand what makes bat biosonar so accurate. Now, Rolf M&#252;ller of Virginia Tech and colleagues have demonstrated that fast jiggling movements of tissue structures on the nose and in the ears of horseshoe bats dramatically boost their ability to pinpoint the source of incoming signals. The results could guide the design of new bioinspired sensors that may give drones location skills as remarkable as those naturally available to bats.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Using computer models and 3D-printed robots, the team quantitatively analyzed how the directional information that bats derive from echoes of their calls is affected by changes in the shape of their noseleaves&#8212;skin and cartilage folds surrounding the bat&#8217;s nostrils&#8212;and of the outer parts of their ears. Specifically, in horseshoe bats, the noseleaves oscillate between an extended and a contracted conformation and the ears between an upright shape and a bent one. Through numerical simulations and experiments with the robots, the authors compared the number of directions that could be distinguished when these structures were static and when they underwent shape changes. They found an increase in the number of resolvable directions by up to 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude when the noseleaves and ears could deform, compared to when they couldn\'t.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This research is published in <i><a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl">Physical Review Letters</a></i>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>&#8211;Matteo Rini</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Matteo Rini is the Deputy Editor of <i><a href="http://physics.aps.org/">Physics</a></i>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr class="wave">\n<div class="show-for-small-only hide-for-print">\n<section class="panel"><div class="link-list-item">\n<h4><a href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.158102">Dynamic Substrate for the Physical Encoding of Sensory Information in Bat Biosonar</a></h4>\n<p>Rolf M&#252;ller, Anupam K.

To achieve and maintain the coherence required for interferometric measurements, most setups use complex laser cooling and trapping methods that keep atomic ensembles at temperatures in the microkelvin range. But now, Grant Biedermann at the Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico and co-workers [<a href="#c5" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c5">5</a>] have demonstrated an atom interferometer that instead uses a warm vapor enclosed in a glass cell. Removing the need for ultrahigh vacuum and laser cooling schemes, the result reverses the current trend towards colder temperatures in atom interferometry, posing an important step towards field applications [<a href="#c6" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c6">6</a>] but also enlarging the technology playground of quantum sensors.</p>\n<p id="d5e106">Atom interferometers are based on the same principles as optical interferometers: After propagating along two separate paths, matter waves recombine, and may interfere constructively or destructively. The interference generates fringes that carry information on effects, such as gravity, that modify the phase of the wave function that describes the propagating atoms. Because atoms in an interferometer move at much slower velocities than light, they are influenced by the effects that alter their phase on a much longer time scale. This makes atom interferometers much more sensitive than optical ones.</p>\n<p id="d5e108">One of the leading atomic interferometry techniques is light-pulse atom interferometry (LPAI). LPAI schemes typically start with clouds of atoms laser cooled to temperatures as low as millionths of a degree kelvin. Laser pulses are then used to control the external degrees of freedom (position, velocity) of the cold atoms via the coupling of the atoms&#8217; internal degrees of freedom (different magnetic and hyperfine states) to light. Such pulses can effectively work both as beam splitters that separate the atoms and as mirrors that deflect them, allowing the realization of interferometric geometries [<a href="#c7" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c7">7</a>].</p>\n<p id="d5e113">Conventional LPAI requires large ensembles of ultracold atoms with narrow velocity distributions that are isolated from the environment. This is only achievable through laser cooling schemes in ultrahigh vacuum chambers. Would it be possible to produce and exploit matter-wave interference phenomena using hot atoms kept in a simple vapor cell? Vapor-cell approaches have previously been used in atomic clocks [<a href="#c8" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c8">8</a>] and magnetometers operated at room temperature. But the extension to more general atom interferometers faces two challenges. The first is the loss of atomic spin polarization due to atom-atom collisions and to collisions between the atoms and the walls of the cell in which they are housed. The second is the random thermal motion of the atoms, which makes it difficult to create and preserve coherent matter-wave-packet superpositions. Biedermann and co-workers have devised a clever scheme that addresses these two challenges.</p>\n<p id="d5e118">To solve the problem of spin-polarization loss, the researchers borrow a trick previously used in vapor-cell sensors [<a href="#c9" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c9">9</a>]. When an atom collides with the walls of the vapor cell, its spin can flip due to the electromagnetic fields generated by unsaturated bonds in the cell&#8217;s walls. Atoms whose spin has been flipped would then not be able to contribute to the interference signal. To hinder this effect, the team deposited a low-vapor-pressure spin antirelaxation coating onto the cell&#8217;s walls, which passivates unsaturated chemical bonds and thus removes spurious fields. This solution reduces the loss in spin polarization to just 10%.</p>\n<p id="d5e123">To tackle the problems deriving from the atoms&#8217; thermal agitation, Biedermann and co-workers selected, within a broad distribution of velocities, only atoms with two well-defined velocity classes. So, instead of preparing cold atomic ensembles with narrow velocity distributions as in conventional LPAIs, the new scheme extracts a subset of atoms from a thermal ensemble. The difference between cold LPAIs and Biedermann<i> et al.</i>&#8217;s setup can be illustrated with an analogy from optical interferometry. LPAI interferometry with coherent atomic matter waves is similar to optical interferometry with a coherent light source&#8212;a laser. Doing interferometry with a warm vapor, on the other hand, is like searching for interferometric effects using the white incoherent light from a common light bulb.</p>\n<p id="d5e128">To select the two subsets of atoms, the researchers use two counterpropagating Raman lasers that simultaneously excite two groups of atoms with opposite velocity, <span class="inline-formula">  <math><mrow><mo>+</mo><msub><mrow><mi>&#120584;</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>z</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math></span> and <span class="inline-formula">  <math><mrow><mo>&#8722;</mo><msub><mrow><mi>&#120584;</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>z</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math></span>, along the laser propagation directions (Fig. <a href="#f1" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="f1">1</a>), where <span class="inline-formula">  <math><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>&#120584;</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>z</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math></span> depends on the frequency of the Raman beams. After selection, the same Raman lasers &#8220;kick&#8221; the atoms in a three-pulse sequence that generates two different paths in a so-called Mach-Zehnder interferometric configuration.</p>\n<p id="d5e271">The difficulty of these experiments is determining the phase difference of the two interfering atom waves from the fringes measured in a warm system with an extremely short coherence length. The solution presented by Biedermann and co-workers consists of simultaneously detecting the two atomic groups (<span class="inline-formula">  <math><mrow><mo>+</mo><msub><mrow><mi>&#120584;</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>z</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math></span> and <span class="inline-formula">  <math><mrow><mo>&#8722;</mo><msub><mrow><mi>&#120584;</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>z</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math></span>) participating in the interferometer. The authors use two additional counterpropagating probe beams (Fig.  <a href="#" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="">1</a>) that measure a differential signal from which the phase difference is extracted. One can show that the two interferometers possess equal and opposite sensitivity to the atoms&#8217; acceleration. The differential signal eliminates noise and offsets that are present in both channels, doubling at the same time the sensitivity to accelerations.</p>\n<p id="d5e304">The Raman lasers &#8220;interrogate&#8221; the hot atoms for a time limited by the average transit time of the atoms across these beams. Because of the atoms&#8217; thermal velocities, this sets the biggest limitation to this scheme, dramatically reducing the interferometer phase sensitivity compared to cold LPAIs. Using the maximum available interrogation time of <span class="inline-formula">  <math><mrow><mn>1</mn><mn>5</mn><mspace width=".5em"></mspace><mi>&#120583;</mi><mtext>s</mtext></mrow></math></span>, this work demonstrates an acceleration sensitivity of <span class="inline-formula">  <math><mrow><mn>1</mn><msup><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><mrow><mo>&#8722;</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup><mi>g</mi><mo rspace="0" lspace="0" stretchy="false">&#8725;</mo><msqrt><mrow><mtext>Hz</mtext></mrow></msqrt></mrow></math></span> (where <i>g</i> is the local gravitational acceleration on Earth, approximately <span class="inline-formula">  <math><mrow><mn>9</mn><mo>.</mo><mn>8</mn><mspace width=".5em"></mspace><msup><mrow><mtext>m&#160;s</mtext></mrow><mrow><mo>&#8722;</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></math></span>)&#8212;five orders of magnitude worse than the current state-of-the-art of atom-interferometry acceleration measurements [<a href="#c1" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c1">1</a>, <a href="#c10" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c10">10</a>]. However, sensitivity is not the only parameter of relevance for applications, and the new scheme offers two important advantages over cold schemes. The first is that it can acquire data at a rate of 10 kHz [<a href="#c11" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c11">11</a>], in contrast to the typical 1-Hz rate of cold-atom LPAIs. The second advantage is the broader range of accelerations that can be measured with the same setup. This vapor-cell sensor remains operational over an acceleration range of <span class="inline-formula">  <math><mrow><mn>8</mn><mn>8</mn><mi>g</mi></mrow></math></span>, several times larger than the typical range of cold LPAIs.</p>\n<p id="d5e389">The large bandwidth and dynamic range of the instrument built by Biedermann and co-workers may enable applications like inertial navigation in highly vibrating environments, such as spacecraft or airplanes. What&#8217;s more, the new scheme, like all LPAIs, has an important advantage over devices like laser or electromechanical gyroscopes: it delivers acceleration measurements that are absolute, without requiring a reference signal. This opens new possibilities for drift-free inertial navigation devices that work even when signals provided by global satellite positioning systems are not available, such as in underwater navigation.</p>\n<p id="d5e392">This research is published in <i>  <a target="xrefwindow" href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/" id="d5e396">Physical Review Letters</a></i>.</p>\n<section><h2>References</h2>\n<ol class="references">\n<li id="c1"><span xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">P Gillot <i>et al.</i>, &#8220;Stability Comparison of Two Absolute Gravimeters: Optical Versus Atomic Interferometers,&#8221; <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/51/5/L15"><span>Metrologia</span> <b>51</b>, L15 (2014)</a>.</span></li>\n<li id="c2"><span xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">P.

If you are a physicist or have a background in physics, it may be the great J. J. Thomson&#8212;discoverer of the electron&#8212;followed by a vision of an old television or oscilloscope powered by cathode-ray tubes. Very twentieth-century stuff. If this is your view, a new study by Jared Maxson at the Pegasus radiation facility at the University of California, Los Angeles, and colleagues [<a href="#c1" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c1">1</a>] should help make clear how electron beams are one of the primary enablers of twenty-first-century science. Ultrashort electron-beam pulses&#8212;less than 10 fs long in this case&#8212;are enabling forms of atomic-level dynamic imaging that were previously restricted to the realm of thought experiments [<a href="#c2" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c2">2</a>].</p>\n<p id="d5e104">It is difficult to overemphasize the impact that electron beams have had on scientific developments over the last century, or the impact they are expected to have over the next century. While electron beams are currently out of favor in high-energy physics, because of the move from electron-positron colliders to hadron colliders at CERN, Fermilab, and other laboratories, they are central to other areas of science. For example, when we want to perform detailed examinations of the structure of molecules and materials, electron beams are at the forefront. Transmission electron microscopes and scanning electron microscopes are remarkably efficient instruments for generating and measuring an enormous range of signals that reveal the structure of materials. These signals come from both the elastic and inelastic interaction of electron beams with materials, and modern materials science is unthinkable without these instruments. When operated at cryogenic temperatures, these same instruments enable 3D reconstructions of proteins, viruses, organelles, and even whole cells [<a href="#c3" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c3">3</a>]. Complementary work can also be performed using synchrotron light sources or free-electron lasers [<a href="#c4" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c4">4</a>], which produce x-ray and infrared beams that are themselves generated from pulsed relativistic electron beams circulating in storage rings or linear accelerators. The size of the facilities that host these instruments, and the properties and limitations of the instruments as sources of x-ray and infrared radiation, are largely determined by the properties of such electron beams.</p>\n<p id="d5e112">Historically, the primary developmental frontiers in electron microscopy have been improvements in spatial resolution and new forms of imaging contrast. For x-ray facilities, it has been beam brightness, brilliance, and coherence. Recently, however, a new frontier has emerged: time resolution. This new frontier is inspired by the goal of developing electron and x-ray instruments that can follow the dynamic structure of matter on all relevant spatiotemporal scales. For many chemical reactions, phase transitions, and elementary excitations, this stated goal requires that sub-angstrom atomic displacements be resolved on time scales below 100 fs. That is, it requires time resolution sufficient to follow even the fastest atomic motion while simultaneously maintaining structural sensitivity equivalent to the best conventional approaches. There are two research directions in particular that take advantage of these capabilities and have generated enormous excitement. One is making &#8220;molecular movies&#8221; that can follow the atomic reorganization of molecules and materials during structural transformations [<a href="#c2" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c2">2</a>]. Another is obtaining atomic images of single particles far beyond the sample&#8217;s damage threshold [<a href="#c6" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c6">5</a>]. This latter direction goes by the name &#8220;diffract and destroy.&#8221;</p>\n<p id="d5e120">Against this backdrop of interest in ultrashort electron pulses, Maxson and colleagues&#8217; work at the Pegasus facility is a landmark. The authors have demonstrated, using an electron source similar to that used to fill the storage ring at synchrotron facilities, that a very high quality electron beam with pulses of duration below 10 fs can be produced. For perspective, the highest-frequency phonons (lattice vibrations) in diamond&#8212;the hardest natural material&#8212;have a period of approximately 20 fs. Only the vibrations of molecules involving hydrogen atoms (C-H, O-H, and N-H) have periods as short as about 10 fs. That is, on time scales below 10 fs, essentially all atomic motion is frozen in molecules and materials. A snapshot of structure taken with 10-fs pulses would represent a truly instantaneous atomic configuration (Fig. <a href="#f1" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="f1">1</a>). The researchers were able to obtain such short pulses by exploring an operating regime of the source that is not particularly attractive for use at synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron-laser facilities (the usual application areas for such electron sources), but that produces beams with very attractive properties for direct use in dynamic-imaging experiments in terms of pulse duration and beam size. The payoff is unprecedented time resolution with a beam diameter capable of probing individual micrometer-sized crystals. The result opens up completely new scientific territory: microcrystallography with 10-fs time resolution. Conventional crystallography makes use of x-ray or electron diffraction patterns to determine atomic structure in equilibrium. With electron pulses as short as 10 fs, researchers will be able to explore the far-from-equilibrium atomic structure of molecules and materials in exquisite detail. That is, we will be able to follow the time-evolving atomic structure with no &#8220;blurring&#8221; of the motions. The micrometer-sized beams mean that millimeter (or larger) crystals, often difficult to produce, will not be necessary for such studies.</p>\n<p id="d5e140">While the Pegasus facility is currently the only one of its kind on a university campus in North America (all other similar facilities are to be found at national labs [<a href="#c6" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c6">6</a>]), these results may lead to more such facilities in the near future. Recently, there has been something of an explosion of interest in methods to produce ultrashort electron-beam pulses in university labs around the world. This is due to the significant scientific impact these approaches are having in materials and molecular physics [<a href="#c7" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c7">7</a>&#8211;<a href="#c10" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c10">10</a>], and the relative accessibility of the technology in terms of cost. Overwhelmingly, these new labs are based on commercial transmission-electron-microscopy platforms [<a href="#c10" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c10">10</a>] or homebuilt instrumentation that also operate at beam energies of 50&#8211;300 keV [<a href="#c11" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c11">11</a>], rather than the MeV energies used in the Pegasus instrument and similar devices. Some of these instruments even use devices to compress the electron pulses in a manner similar to the current work [<a href="#c12" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c12">12</a>].</p>\n<p id="d5e161">The higher beam energy of Pegasus carries with it significant additional cost, complexity, and even radiation safety issues. But it also has several important fundamental advantages. The impact of Coulomb repulsion inside the ultrashort electron pulses that determines instrument capabilities and performance (such as pulse duration and fluence) at the nonrelativistic beam energies is dramatically reduced through relativistic effects. This factor helps to explain why both the electron-pulse duration (10 fs) and the beam diameter (5 micrometers) demonstrated in the current work are both roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the state of the art in nonrelativistic instruments at the same number of electrons per pulse. A factor of 10 in both of these key metrics means that qualitatively new types of measurements will be possible. The next step is thus to start thinking up great measurements that could take advantage of this breakthrough.</p>\n<p id="d5e163">This research is published in <i>  <a target="xrefwindow" href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/" id="d5e167">Physical Review Letters</a></i>.</p>\n<section><h2>References</h2>\n<ol class="references">\n<li id="c1"><span xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">J.

New calculations show that irregularly shaped particles can display novel behavior during sedimentation that does not occur for more symmetric objects. Such particles can drift laterally so as to smooth out density variations that occur during settling, a result that potentially resolves a long-standing  discrepancy between theory and experiment over the magnitude of such variations. The theory may help explain the progress of sedimentation in both natural and industrial contexts.</p>\n<p id="d5e83"> </p>\n<p id="d5e101">Sedimentation is important in water treatment and industrial processes that rely on dense suspensions flowing as fluids, and it also influences the paths of rivers and the accumulation of geological deposits. Variations from place to place in the concentration of particles affect the progress of sedimentation. A volume with fewer particles will have greater overall buoyancy than an equal volume containing more particles, so the denser volume will fall faster. For a random distribution, fluctuations in the number of particles grow with the volume, leading to a theoretical prediction 30 years ago that vertical velocity fluctuations in a sediment should depend on the size of the sedimenting system rather than on intrinsic properties of the sediment itself [<a href="#c1" class="ref-target inline-ref-target" data-ref-target="c1">1</a>]. Most experimental and observational evidence contradicts this prediction.</p>\n<p id="d5e106"> </p>\n<p id="d5e108">Tomer Goldfriend and Haim Diamant of Tel Aviv University and Thomas Witten of the University of Chicago now suggest a resolution of this discrepancy. They point out that studies of sedimentation have assumed particles that are spherical or at least have sufficient symmetry that their center of mass coincides with their geometrical center&#8212;for example, a rod of uniform density. Such objects have no preferred orientation in a gravitational field. In reality, the researchers say, sedimenting particles will most likely have irregular shapes that orient in a specific direction as they fall under gravity. That additional detail turns out to have important consequences.</p>\n<p id="d5e110"> </p>\n<p id="d5e112">The researchers consider a sedimentary flow whose density varies in the horizontal direction. The greater downward velocity of a denser region compared to an adjacent, more rarefied region will tip a particle between them out of its preferred alignment. As this misaligned particle drifts down through the liquid, it will develop a small sideways velocity. This lateral motion, the team argues, will depend in a complicated way on the shape and mass distribution of the particle, but in general, the faster the downward motion, the greater the sideways velocity. And this sideways motion could take particles from higher to lower density regions, or vice versa.</p>\n<p id="d5e114"> </p>\n<p id="d5e116">In short, misaligned particles will move in such a way that they either reduce or magnify the initial density variations. As a simple example, Witten suggests a grain of rice that is heavier at one end. If the downward flow rate increases as you go from left to right, say, the grain&#8217;s heavier bottom end will tilt to the left. Thus tilted, it will tend to glide to the left as it moves down&#8212;meaning that it moves toward the region of slower downward flow and lower particle density. In this case, sideways motion acts to diminish the variations in particle density.</p>\n<p id="d5e118"> </p>\n<p id="d5e121">The researchers back up this qualitative picture with calculations using the method of fluctuating hydrodynamics, in which the flow velocity at any time and location is treated not as a single value but as a statistical quantity, with some mean and variation. The method makes it possible to relate the flow rates of sedimenting particles to local variations in their density and confirms that self-aligning particles can indeed smooth out density variations.</p>\n<p id="d5e123"> </p>\n<p id="d5e125">The calculations assume that all of the particles are identical, but the researchers say that in a sediment with a mix of self-aligning and spherical particles, the former will move independently of the latter, so as to erase any overall density variations. Russel Caflisch, a UCLA theorist who was one of the first to point out the problem with velocity fluctuations during sedimentation, says he\'s "impressed by the results."

It&#8217;s time to place your bets, for NASA&#8217;s Cassini spacecraft, which has spent the past 13 years exploring the planet and its moons, is finally swooping close enough to take a look.</p>\n\n<p>On 26 April, it will thread the gap between the gas giant and its rings in the first of 22 week-long orbits that will culminate in September with a fiery and fatal plunge into the atmosphere. The Grand Finale, as NASA is calling the forays, should help answer questions about Saturn&#8217;s atmosphere and interior. But most of all, it should end a debate about the mass of the water ice rings, which is a big clue to their age&#8212;whether they are 4.5 billion years old, nearly as old as the planet, or much younger. The Cassini team has a betting pool on the mass: $5 a wager, due before the first orbit.</p>\n\n<p>The route will be dangerous. The gap contains ice particles finer than soot, which ought not to harm the spacecraft. But if the models are wrong, and Cassini collides at 122,000 kilometers per hour with something even as large as a BB, the mission will end early. &#8220;This is something we wouldn&#8217;t want to try at another time,&#8221; says Earl Maize, the Cassini program manager at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) in Pasadena, California. To be cautious, on its first pass, Cassini will hide behind its large antenna, using it as a shield to protect its instruments.</p>\n\n<p>As the spacecraft plunges toward the rings in subsequent orbits, a radio telescope in Argentina will be listening for tiny Doppler shifts in Cassini&#8217;s signal. Those will allow the team to tease out the gravitational pull of the rings from that of Saturn&#8212;a distinction that could not be made when Cassini was orbiting outside the rings, says Luciano Iess, a planetary scientist at the Sapienza University of Rome. The measurement could provide a verdict on the rings&#8217; mass&#8212;and their age.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, many scientists have assumed that the rings are nearly as old as Saturn itself&#8212;massive structures formed of icy planetary building blocks. Early on, Cassini showed the B ring, one of four main rings, to be bright and nearly opaque, bolstering the view that the ice particles are dense and that the rings have a total mass greater than Saturn&#8217;s 400-kilometer-wide moon, Mimas.</p>\n  \n  <figure class="figure__minimal entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-related-articles align-right"><article class="media media--var media--priority-2"><div class="media__icon">\n        \n  \n      <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/food-microbes-abundant-enceladus"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.sciencemag.org//www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/grid_thumb_-_290x163__16_9_/public/4852_PIA11688_1280x720.jpg?itok=lNtM6FkI" alt="An image of Enceladus plumes"></a>  \n      </div>\n    \n    <div class="media__body">\n              <h3 class="overline"></h3>\n      \n\n      \n      <h2 class="media__headline">\n        <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/food-microbes-abundant-enceladus">Food for microbes abundant on Enceladus</a>\n      </h2>\n          </div>\n  </article></figure><p>But an alternate view is gaining credence: that the rings are more delicate structures formed within the last 100 million years from the smashed ice of a lost moon. An age of 4.5 billion years is hard to reconcile with their pristine color, because a steady stream of sooty micrometeoroids from interplanetary space should have darkened them by now, like drops of black ink spreading in a pool of white paint. Moreover, the spacing between rippling, spiral waves within the rings, created by gravitational resonances with Saturn&#8217;s moons, can offer another clue to mass, and judging from a handful of wavelets recently spied within the bright B ring, it is low. Iess believes the total mass of the rings to be just 20% to 80% of Mimas.</p>\n\n<p>Cassini may reveal another clue when its close passage gives it the best view yet of the interior C and D rings. Amid the C ring&#8217;s icy particles, there are hints of larger chunks of rubble, says Jeff Cuzzi, a ring specialist at NASA&#8217;s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, who believes the rings are young. &#8220;This could even be the core of the object that formed the rings.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>By catching stray ring particles, the spacecraft could also learn more about the makeup of the rings themselves, which are at least 90% water ice. Their distinctive shade of taupe could come from reddish iron oxide or carotene, the orange of carrots.</p>\n\n<p>As the spacecraft&#8217;s orbits take it ever closer to Saturn itself, it will shift its attention from the rings to the planet&#8217;s roiling ammonia clouds. Its cameras should see the structure of storms, and shadows could reveal the architecture of sharp lines of clouds that may extend for several thousand kilometers. Close-up measurements of the planet&#8217;s magnetic field could finally reveal the length of a day on Saturn. With no solid surface to define a day, scientists hope to use periodic patterns in Saturn&#8217;s magnetic field to get at the rotation of its interior.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in the last five orbits, &#8220;we&#8217;re going to dip our toe into the atmosphere of Saturn,&#8221; says Linda Spilker, the Cassini project scientist at JPL. It will be the first time humanity has sampled the atmosphere of a gas giant since the Galileo spacecraft dropped a probe into Jupiter in 1995. If they get lucky, researchers could estimate the abundances of helium and hydrogen in Saturn&#8217;s outer layers, which, in turn, could help illuminate its interior structure and how gas giants form.</p>\n\n<p>On its final dive into Saturn, on 15 September, Cassini will point its antenna to Earth, but the spacecraft should go silent quickly, vaporizing within 3 minutes. Planners deemed it necessary to destroy Cassini rather than leave it wandering near Saturn because it may carry stowaway terrestrial microbes that could contaminate two Saturn moons, Titan and Enceladus, that have potentially habitable conditions.</p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s much to do before then. Cuzzi, though he favors youthful, low-mass rings, hasn&#8217;t gotten his bet into the pool yet. He&#8217;s waiting until the last minute. &#8220;I know time is getting short.&#8221;</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="In mission\'s last hurrah, Cassini aims to solve riddle of Saturn\'s rings" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',

Now, it turns out that the jets contain hydrogen gas, a sign of ongoing reactions on the floor of that alien sea. Because such chemistry provides energy for microbial life on Earth, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/155">the discovery makes Enceladus the top candidate for hosting life elsewhere in the solar system</a>&#8212;besting even Jupiter&#8217;s Europa, another icy moon with an ocean. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t see microbes,&#8221; says Hunter Waite, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, and the lead author of a study published this week in <em>Science</em>. &#8220;But we saw their food.&#8221;</p>\n  \n  <figure class="figure__minimal entity entity-paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-related-articles align-right"><article class="media media--var media--priority-2"><div class="media__icon">\n        \n  \n      <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/missions-last-hurrah-cassini-aims-solve-riddle-saturns-rings"><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.sciencemag.org//www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/grid_thumb_-_290x163__16_9_/public/ca_0414NID_Cassini_Path_1280x720.jpg?itok=PbjRTulf" alt="An artist\'s conception of Cassini\'s orbit"></a>  \n      </div>\n    \n    <div class="media__body">\n              <h3 class="overline"></h3>\n      \n\n      \n      <h2 class="media__headline">\n        <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/missions-last-hurrah-cassini-aims-solve-riddle-saturns-rings">In mission\'s last hurrah, Cassini aims to solve riddle of Saturn\'s rings</a>\n      </h2>\n          </div>\n  </article></figure><p>In previous passes through the plumes, the Cassini team found organic molecules like methane and formaldehyde. A final pass in October 2015, just 48 kilometers above the surface, revealed something even more tantalizing: abundant hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>). The authors argue that it comes from hydrothermal activity on the ocean floor, perhaps seafloor vents like those on Earth that spew H<sub>2</sub>&#160;and support rich microbial life. It could be produced by water reacting with iron, or similar reactions baking out primitive organic molecules trapped in the rocky core.</p>\n\n<p>Waite and his colleagues were previously blind to hydrogen in the plumes because of surges of it created in their own instrument when water reacted with its titanium components. All the potential biases seem accounted for now, says Gabriel Tobie, a planetary scientist at the University of Nantes in France who was unaffiliated with the study. The high volume of hydrogen is a puzzle, as are spikes in its abundance, but it is not the only evidence of seafloor activity on Enceladus. In 2015, Cassini scientists studied particles from Saturn&#8217;s E ring, known to be fed by Enceladus&#8217;s plumes, and found tiny glass beads that could have only come from hydrothermal reactions. &#8220;These converging pieces of evidence tell us that something special is happening inside Enceladus,&#8221; Tobie says.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, NASA is pinning its hopes for life on Europa, with the $2 billion Europa Clipper planned for launch in the next decade. The Hubble telescope has seen signs of a plume on Europa erupting twice from the same spot, according to a study in this week&#8217;s issue of&#160;<em>The Astrophysical Journal</em>. But the signal is contested, and there&#8217;s no evidence yet of hydrothermal activity.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to second guess targets at all,&#8221; says Waite, who leads an instrument on the Clipper. But he thinks Enceladus is just begging to be sampled with a mission designed for the task.</p>\n  \n<span property="dc:title" content="Food for microbes abundant on Enceladus" class="rdf-meta element-hidden"></span>\n            </div></body></html>\n',
